Doch dann zogen Doras Eltern nach Frankreich, und Luka blieb allein zuruck. Als Mittzwanziger treffen sie sich nun uberraschend in Paris wieder, und es ist klar: Sie gehoren einfach zusammen. Drei gluckliche Monate folgen, aus denen ein gemeinsames Leben werden soll; nur kurz will Luka in die Heimat zuruck, um ein paar Dinge in Ordnung zu bringen - und dann meldet er sich nicht mehr. Jeden Tag, jede Stunde ist eine jener aussergewohnlichen Liebesgeschichten, die zugleich zeitlos und modern sind: zeitlos in ihrem Glauben an die Vorbestimmtheit, mit der zwei Menschen ein Schicksal teilen, und modern in ihrem Wissen, dass das Leben sich als viel schwieriger erweist.\nEin Liebesroman, wie er sein sollte: poetisch, von grosser emotionaler Strahlkraft, mitreissend erzahlt.","OCR edition without illustrations or index. It may have numerous typos or missing text.\nPressured by her unscrupulous family to marry a wealthy man she detests, the young Clarissa Harlowe is tricked into fleeing with the witty and debonair Robert Lovelace and places herself under his protection. Lovelace, however, proves himself to be an untrustworthy rake whose vague promises of marriage are acpanied by unwele and incregly brutal sexual advances. And yet, Clarissa finds his charm alluring, her scrupulous sense of virtue tinged with unconfessed desire.\nTold through a plex series of interweaving letters, \"Clarissa\" is a richly ambiguous study of a fatally attracted couple and a work of astonishing power and immediacy. A huge success when it first appeared in 1747, and translated into French and German, it remains one of the greatest of all European novels. Its rich ambiguities - our sense of Clarissa's scrupulous virtue tinged with intimations of her capacity for self-deception in matters of sex; the wicked and amusing faces of Lovelace, who must be easily the most charming villain in English literature - give the story extraordinary psychological momentum. .","Angelle, God's first Angel, fell from grace along with Satan.

They turn for advice to Annie Fuller, a widowed boardinghouse owner who supplements her ine as a clairvoyant, Madam Sibyl.\nFor those who have read Locke's two full-length Victorian San Francisco mysteries, Maids of Misfortune and Uneasy Spirits, and her other short story, Dandy Detects, this is an amusing glimpse into the lives of Annie Fuller's two most eccentric boarders. For those unfamiliar with Locke's mysteries and the late nineteenth century world they portray, this is just a taste of things to e.","Against a vivid backdrop of history, Danielle Steel tells a pelling story of love and war, acts of faith and acts of betrayal...and of three generations of women as they journey though years of loss and survival, linked by an indomitable devotion that echoes across time.\nFor the Wittgenstein family, the summer of 1915 was a time of both prosperity and unease, as the guns of war sound in the distance. But for eldest daughter Beata, it was also a summer of awakening. By the glimmering waters of Lake Geneva, the quiet Jewish beauty met a young French officer and fell in love. Knowing that her parents would never accept her marriage to a Catholic, Beata followed her heart anyway. And as the two built a new life together, Beata's past would stay with her in ways she could never have predicted. For as the years pass, and Europe is once again engulfed in war, Beata must watch in horror as Hitler's terror threatens her life and family--even her eighteen-year-old daughter Amadea, who has taken on the vows of a Carmelite nun.\nFor Amadea, the convent is no refuge. As family and friends are swept away without a trace, Amadea is forced into hiding. Thus begins a harrowing journey of survival, as she escapes into the heart of the French Resistance. Here Amadea will find a renewed sense of purpose, taking on the most daring missions behind enemy lines. And it is here, in the darkest moments of fear, that Amadea will feel her mother's loving strength--and that of her mother's mother before her-as the voices of lost loved ones echo powerfully in her heart. And here, amid the fires of war, Amadea will meet an extraordinary man, British secret agent Rupert Montgomery. In Colonel Montgomery, Amadea finds a man who will help her discover her place in an unbreakable chain between generations...and between her lost family and her dreams for the future--a future she is only just beginning to imagine: a future of hope rooted in the rich soil of the past.\nWith the grace of a master storyteller, Danielle Steel breathes life into history, creating a bold, sweeping tale filled with unforgettable characters and breathtaking images--from the elegant rituals of Europe's prewar aristocracy to the brutal desperation of Germany's death camps. Drawing us into a vanished world, Echoes weaves an intricate tapestry of a mother's love, a daughter's courage...and the unwavering faith that sustained them--even in history's darkest hour.\nFrom the Hardcover edition.","Osprey's Campaign title for Sekigahara (1600), which was the most decisive battle in Japanese history. Fought against the ritualised and colourful backdrop of Samurai life, it was the culmination of a long-standing power struggle between Tokugawa Ieyasu and Hashiba Hideyoshi, two of the most powerful men in Japan. Armies of the two sides met on the plain of Sekigahara on 21 October 1600, in thick fog and deep mud. By the end of the day 40,000 heads had been taken and Ieyasu was master of Japan. Within three years the Emperor would grant him the title he sought - Shogun. This title describes the campaign leading up to this great battle and examines Sekigahara, including the forces and personalities of the two major sides and that of the turncoat Kobayakawa Hideaki.","The last place you'd expect to find a team of criminals is at a prestigious Philadelphia prep school.

The heat gets turned WAY up in this multicultural romance!\nPROLOGUE\nBefore him was a real woman. She had tits and ass for days, and her stomach wasn't exactly flat. It wouldn't have looked right if it was. It was curvy just like the rest of her. Her curves gave him plenty to hang onto as his cock slammed in and out of her time and time again.\nHe found himself imagining her pushed up against the concrete wall out in the alley, exploring every crevice of that glorious silky skin as she spread her legs and begged him for more. The valley between her breasts invited his tongue to explore the soft skin between it, work his way around and up to the swollen nipple, sucking as if his life depended on it.\nThose hips ... they're what set his cock on fire. He could feel the blood pulsating along the ridges, growing inch by inch as he thought of what it would be like to grab a meaty handful of her lushness to steady himself and drive into her slippery pussy again and again.\nCould he make her cry out his name, as he had so many?\nHe could spot a woman who needed a good fuck a mile away. There was something in the eyes - a searching, a yearning that was plain to see -- if you knew what to look for. And judging by the look in this beauty's face, she hadn't ridden cock in a while.\nHe stubbed out the cigarette he'd been holding, rearranged his hard member in his pants and walked out of the shadow of the darkness. It was time for some answers.\n***\nTara entered the doors of the bar and her nostrils were immediately assaulted by the odor of cigarettes and stale alcohol. She was definitely in the right place. Since New York City had banned smoking in public establishments like restaurants and bars years over a decade ago, the fact that this one ignored the rules made it ideal for what she wanted tonight -- a good, hard fuck by a no-name, big-dick stranger she could send on his way when it was done.\nShe slid onto the torn vinyl of the bar stool. She could feel the scratch of the torn edges on her skin through her tight, black lace dress.\n\"Whisky. Neat,\" she said to the burly bartender. She started her hunt there. Bartenders were usually easy targets; they could be sure things because they were used to hooking up with random girls and more than happy to be on their way right after.\n***\n\"I'm Gideon,\" he said, extending his large hand.\n\"Tara,\" she said succinctly.\n\"So Tara, may I ask what brings you into a dive like this? You know you're out of place, right?\"\n\"Not for what I want,\" she said, openly perusing him. \"... and I think you know exactly what I want. That's why you came over here. ... Well tonight's your lucky night Gideon,\" she said, swiveling her legs around on the bar stool and facing him. \"I'm tired of talking. Let's keep it simple and get out of here,\" she said, downing the remainder of her whiskey.\nGideon put a twenty dollar bill on the bar, nodded at the bartender and extended his hand to Tara to help her off the bar stool.

But far more than the riveting account of a break-in, this is a daring exploration of place and the boundaries upon which identities are mapped.\nAs a child growing up in apartheid South Africa, Gevisser bees obsessed with a street guide called Holmden's Register of Johannesburg, which literally erases entire black townships. Johannesburg, he realizes, is full of divisions between black and white, rich and poor, gay and straight; a place that \"draws its energy precisely from its atomization and its edge, its stacking of boundaries against one another.\" Here, Gevisser embarks on a quest to understand the inner life of his city.\nGevisser uses maps, family photographs, shards of memory, newspaper clippings, and courtroom testimony to chart his intimate history of Johannesburg. He begins by tracing his family's journey from the Orthodox world of a Lithuanian shtetl to the white suburban neighborhoods where separate servants' quarters were legally required at every house. Gevisser, who eventually marries a black man, tells stories of others who have learned to define themselves \"within, and across, and against,\" the city's boundaries. He recalls the double lives of gay men like Phil and Edgar, the ever-present housekeepers and gardeners, and the private swimming pools where blacks and whites could be discreetly intimate, even though the laws of apartheid strictly prohibited sex between people of different races. And he explores physical barriers like The Wilds, a large park that divides Johannesburg's affluent Northern Suburbs from two of its poorest neighborhoods. It is this park that the three men who held Gevisser at gunpoint crossed the night of their crime.\nAn ode to both the marked and unmarked landscape of Gevisser's past, Lost and Found inJohannesburg is an existential guide to one of the most plex cities on earth. As Gevisser writes, \"Maps would have no purchase on us, no currency at all, if we were not in danger of running aground, of getting lost, of dislocation and even death without them. All maps awaken in me a desire to be lost and to be found . . . [They force] me to remember something I must never allow myself to forget: Johannesburg, my hometown, is not the city I think I know.\"","The siege of Sarajevo lasted for 1.425 days.

The go-to mentator for such programs as Fox News's Hannity and CNN's Larry King Live and Reliable Sources, S. E. Cupp is just that--a reliable source for the latest news, trends, and forecasts in young, bright, conservative America.

Are patents and copyrights legitimate?\nShaffer responds with an appeal to fundamental libertarian principles. Only arrangements that people freely negotiate with one another are acceptable: laws imposed by a coercive state are not. Judged by this standard, intellectual property fails. People may make contracts that limit the sale or transmission of ideas or books, but these bind only those who make them. Intellectual property laws, by contrast, apply to everyone, whether people accept them or not. These laws could not have arisen through voluntary agreements.\nDefenders of intellectual property maintain that inventors and writers need protection for their work. Without patents and copyrights, inventions and creative work would be impeded. Shaffer responds that most of the great creators and inventors of the past worked without patent s and copyrights. Leonardo da Vinci and Shakespeare, for example, did rather well without this sort of state privilege.\nA Libertarian Critique of Intellectual Propertyis a major contribution to libertarian legal theory and an indispensable guide to a vital topic.","By 1849, Jessamine Brady has been in the Shaker Village for half her life, but in spite of how she loves her sisters there, she struggles to conform to the strict rules.

Semipro baseball was highly petitive in the 1930s, so petitive that even out on the Great Plains a lot of money got bet on games between rival towns. Car dealer Neil Churchill managed Bismarck, North Dakota's team. He began muscling up by luring players from the Negro Leagues, the biggest prize being the great-but-perpetually-unpredictable Satchel Paige, who shocked the baseball establishment by heading west to where the buffalo roam.

Each generation has produced one or two phenomenally successful leaders, often in new industries that caught contemporaries by surprise, and each of these new fortunes reconfirmed the power of fanatically single-minded visionaries. John Jacob Astor and Cornelius Vanderbilt were the first American moguls; John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and J. P. Morgan were kingpins of the Gilded Age; David Sarnoff, Walt Disney, Ray Kroc, and Sam Walton were masters of mass culture. Today Oprah Winfrey, Andy Grove, and Bill Gates are giants of the Information Age. America has again and again been the land of dizzying mountains of wealth. Here, in a wittily told and deeply insightful history, is a plete set of portraits of America's greatest generators of wealth. Only such a collective study allows us to appreciate what makes the great entrepreneurs really tick. As H. W. Brands shows, these men and women are driven, they are focused, they deeply identify with the businesses they create, and they possess the charisma necessary to persuade other talented people to join them. They do it partly for the money, but mostly for the thrill of creation.\nThe stories told here -- including how Nike got its start as a business-school project for Phil Knight; how Robert Woodruff almost refused to take control of Coca-Cola to spite his father; how Thomas Watson saved himself from prison by rescuing Dayton, Ohio, from a flood; how Jay Gould nearly cornered the gold market; how H. L. Hunt went from gambling at cards to gambling with oilleases -- make for a narrative that is always lively and revealing and often astonishing. An observer in 1850, studying John Jacob Astor, would not have predicted the rise of Henry Ford and the auto industry. Nor would a student of Ford in 1950 have anticipated the takeoff of direct marketing that made Mary Kay Ash a trusted guide for millions of American women. Full of surprising insights, written with H. W. Brands's trademark flair, the stories in \"Masters of Enterprise\" are must reading for all students of American business history.","Called on a stormy day to his first murder scene as the new mander of investigations, Inspector Avraham Avraham is astounded to discover he knows the victim: a middle-aged woman who had been assaulted in the past.

It was one of the most devastating human disasters in history.\n\"The bodies were sparsely covered that the dogs dragged them forth and devoured them . And believing it to be the end of the world, no one wept for the dead, for all expected to die.\" Agnolo di Turo, Siena, 1348\nIn just over 1000 days from 1347 to 1351 the 'Black Death' swept across medieval Europe killing 30% of it's population. It was a catastrophe that touched the lives of every individual on the continent. The deadly Y. Pestis virus entered Europe by Genoese galley at Messina, Sicily in October 1347. By the spring of 1348 it was devastating the cities of central Italy, by June 1348 it had swept in to France and Spain, and by August it had reached England. One graphic testimony can be found at St Mary's, Ashwell, Hertfordshire, where an anonymous hand carved a harrowing inscription for 1349: 'Wretched, terrible, destructive year, the remnants of the people alone remain.'\nAccording to the Foster scale, a kind of Richter scale of human disaster, the plague of 1347-51 is the second worst catastrophe in recorded history. Only World War II produced more death, physical damage, and emotional suffering. It is also the closest thing that Defence Analysts pare a thermonuclear war to - in geographical extent, abruptness and casualties.\nIn The Great MortalityJohn Kelly retraces the journey of the Black Death using original source material - diary fragments, letters, manuscripts - as it swept across Europe. It is harrowing portrait of a continent gripped by an epidemic, but also a very personal story narrated by the individuals whose lives were touched by it.","Dan Savage's nationally syndicated sex advice column, \"Savage Love,\" enrages and excites more than four million people each week. In The Kid, Savage tells a no-holds-barred, high-energy story of an ordinary American couple who wants to have a baby. Except that in this case the couple happens to be Dan and his boyfriend. That fact, in the face of a society enormously uneasy with gay adoption, makes for an edgy, entertaining, and illuminating read. When Dan and his boyfriend are finally presented with an infant badly in need of parenting, they find themselves caught up in a drama that extends well beyond the confines of their immediate world. A story about confronting homophobia, falling in love, getting older, and getting a little bit smarter, The Kid is a book about the very human desire to have a family.","Oprah Book Club(r) Selection, September 2000:For 19th-century novelists--from Jane Austen to George Eliot, Flaubert to Henry James--social constraint gave a delicious tension to their plots. Yet now our relaxed morals and social mobility have rendered many of the classics untenable. Why shouldn't Maisie know what she knows? It will all e out in family therapy anyway. The vogue for historical novels depends in part on our pleasure in reentering a world of subtle cues and repressed emotion, a time in which a young woman could destroy her life by saying yes to the wrong man. After all, there was no reliable birth control, no divorce, no chance of an independent life or a scandal-free separation. Christina Schwarz's suspenseful debut pivots on two of the lost \"virtues\" of the past: silence and stoicism. Drowning Ruthopens in 1919, on the heels of the influenza epidemic that followed the First World War. Although there were telephones and motor cars and dance halls in the small towns of Wisconsin in those years, the townspeople remained rigid and forbidding. As a young woman, Amanda Starkey, a Lutheran farmer's daughter, had been firmly discouraged from an inappropriate marriage with a neighboring Catholic boy. A few years later, as a nurse in Milwaukee, she is seduced by a dishonorable man. Her shame sends her into a nervous breakdown, and she returns to the family farm. Within a year, though, her beloved sister Mathilde drowns under mysterious circumstances. And when Mathilde's husband, Carl, returns from the war, he finds his small daughter, Ruth, in Amanda's tenacious grip, and she will tell him nothing about the night his wife drowned. Amanda's parents, too, are long gone. \"I killed my parents. Had I mentioned that?\" muses Amanda. \nI killed them because I felt a little fatigued and suffered from a slight, persistent cough. Thinking I was overworked and hadn't been getting enough sleep, I went home for a short visit, just a few days to relax in the country while the sweet corn and the raspberries were ripe. From the city I brought fancy ribbon, two boxes of Ambrosia chocolate, and a deadly gift... I gave the influenza to my mother, who gave it to my father, or maybe it was the other way around. Schwarz is a skillful writer, weaving her grim tale across several decades, always returning to the fateful night of Mathilde's death. Drowning Ruthdisplays her gift for pacing and her harsh insistence on the right ending, rather than the cheery one. --Regina Marler","Alina knows she is not real - the fae queen spun an evil web to create her - but she wants more than to spend her days feeding off humans' energy to survive.

Misremembered as the 'Nine Days Queen', she has been mythologized as a child-woman destroyed on the altar of political expediency. Behind the legend, however, was an opinionated and often rebellious adolescent who died a passionate leader, not merely a victim. Growing up in Jane's shadow, her sisters Katherine and Mary would have to tread carefully to survive.\nThe dramatic lives of the younger Grey sisters remain little known, but under English law they were the heirs - and rivals - to the Tudor monarchs Mary and Elizabeth I. The beautiful Katherine ignored Jane's dying request that she remain faithful to her beliefs, changing her religion to retain Queen Mary's favour only to then risk life and freedom in a secret marriage that threatened Queen Elizabeth's throne.\nWhile Elizabeth's closest adviser fought to save Katherine, her younger sister Mary remained at court as the queen's Maid of Honour. Too plain to be considered significant, it seemed that Lady Mary Grey, at least, would escape the burden of her royal blood. But then she too fell in love, and incurred the queen's fury.\nExploding the many myths of Lady Jane's life and casting fresh light onto Elizabeth's reign, acclaimed historian Leanda de Lisle brings the tumultuous world of the Grey sisters to life, at a time when a royal marriage could gain you a kingdom or cost you everything.","Blurb: Writer Liv Corrigan has the worst luck with men -- her telepathy tends to make them run for the hills.

[Pretty Sinister Books]","A powerful expeditionary force is despatched from the West, tasked with effecting regime change in a Middle Eastern state ... It is spring 401 BC, and a vast army of Greek mercenary soldiers travels to Persia to aid the satrap Cyrus in his attempt to overthrow his brother and take the Persian throne. When Cyrus is killed, the expedition turns to disaster. Stranded in enemy territory, betrayed by its Persian allies, the army is in mortal danger, until its manders, including the Athenian Xenophon, take charge and lead the men on a perilous retreat. This is Xenophon's eyewitness account of those events.\nThe march of the Ten Thousand was one of the most famous and gruelling military journeys in all history. The foot-soldiers travelled 1,500 miles across enemy terrain, through present-day Iraq, Syria and Turkey, towards the shores of the Black Sea. They faced terrible hunger, six-foot snowdrifts, attacks from the Persian military and from local inhabitants, and the threat of mutiny and division. Yet this ragged army was a democracy on the move. Rallied by the brilliant Xenophon, the soldiers elected officers, debated strategy and resolved disputes through arbitration. Their fortitude was finally rewarded by the sight of the coast, which they greeted with the triumphant, and now famous cry, 'The sea, the sea!'\nThe Persian Expedition is one of the best surviving portraits both of the Persian Empire, antiquity's first genuine superpower, and of the ancient Greek character in all its valour and plexity. It has thrilled the imagination for centuries, and inspired countless manders from Julius Caesar to the Duke of Wellington. Eunapius of Sardis wrote that 'Alexander would never have bee \"great\" without Xenophon'. In the classic translation by Rex Warner, it remains an enthralling account of an epic adventure.

Yet there's a black hole at the heart of biology. We do not know why plex life is the way it is, or, for that matter, how life first began. In The Vital Question, award-winning author and biochemist Nick Lane radically reframes evolutionary history, putting forward a solution to conundrums that have puzzled generations of scientists.\nFor two and a half billion years, from the very origins of life, single-celled organisms such as bacteria evolved without changing their basic form. Then, on just one occasion in four billion years, they made the jump to plexity. All plex life, from mushrooms to man, shares puzzling features, such as sex, which are unknown in bacteria. How and why did this radical transformation happen?\nThe answer, Lane argues, lies in energy: all life on Earth lives off a voltage with the strength of a lightning bolt. Building on the pillars of evolutionary theory, Lane's hypothesis draws on cutting-edge research into the link between energy and cell biology, in order to deliver a pelling account of evolution from the very origins of life to the emergence of multicellular organisms, while offering deep insights into our own lives and deaths.\nBoth rigorous and enchanting, The Vital Questionprovides a solution to life's vital question: why are we as we are, and indeed, why are we here at all?","Almost a hundred years ago, the Enchanters defeated the Lord of the Underworld in one of the most fearsome wars the world had ever seen.

I loafe and invite my soul, I lean and loafe at my ease....observing a spear of summer grass. So begins Leaves of Grass, the first great American poem and indeed, to this day, the greatest and most essentially American poem in all our national literature. The publication of Leaves of Grass in July 1855 was a landmark event in literary history. Ralph Waldo Emerson judged the book \"the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom America has yet contributed.\" Nothing like the volume had ever appeared before. Everything about it--the unusual jacket and title page, the exuberant preface, the twelve free-flowing, untitled poems embracing every realm of experience--was new. The 1855 edition broke new ground in its relaxed style, which prefigured free verse; in its sexual candor; in its images of racial bonding and democratic togetherness; and in the intensity of its affirmation of the sanctity of the physical world. This Anniversary Edition captures the typeface, design and layout of the original edition supervised by Whitman himself. Today's readers get a sense of the \"ur-text\" of Leaves of Grass, the first version of this historic volume, before Whitman made many revisions of both format and style. The volume also boasts an afterword by Whitman authority David Reynolds, in which he discusses the 1855 edition in its social and cultural contexts: its background, its reception, and its contributions to literary history. There is also an appendix containing the early responses to the volume, including Emerson's letter, Whitman's three self-reviews, and the twenty other known reviews published in various newspapers and magazines. This special volume will be a must-have keepsake for fans of Whitman and lovers of American poetry.","When Amy returns to a long-cherished place and reconnects with an old friend, she discovers that her grace and ease with horses does not always carry over into her relationships with people.\nAfter Amy hears of the death of her mentor, she is surprised when his granddaughter, Carey, mysteriously invites her to visit.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. John Dewey recognized that \"children's development and learning were anything but rational and orderly, he and his followers advocated a child-centered and munity-centered curriculum to give students experiences that make rigorous intellectual demands in the contexts of democratic social living. \"The Child and the Curriculum\" looks at the process of education from both perspectives - child and curriculum. Dewey leads the reader to view the curriculum, what the child must learn, from the child's present state of mind. He also considers the teachers point of view as the vehicle that imparts and delivers the curriculum. Dewey understood that the structure of a child's mind is far different from that of an adult. A child does not have a framework in which to classify and place all the information he is receiving. The child is still developing both the context and the framework to process information about the world around him. The child's interests lie in the world of persons and relationships as opposed to that of facts and laws.","From 1943 to 1949, tens of thousands of Greek soldiers and guerrillas fought and slaughtered each other and thousands of innocents in a civil war of unrelenting and shocking savagery.

Their tribe has moved and escaped for thousands of years - across oceans, deserts, and mountains - but now, it seems, there is nowhere else to go. Danger is imminent in every direction, yet the territory of imagination and belief is limitless.\nAt the suggestion of an eleven-year-old girl and a mysterious stranger who has washed up on the riverbank, the villagers decide to reinvent the world: deny any relationship with the known and start over from scratch. Destiny is unwritten. Time and history are forgotten. Jobs, husbands, a child, are reassigned. And for years, there is boundless hope.

In the 58 pages of let you will find but one of the results of Bingham's journeys of discovery into the interior of Peru (See also INCA LAND - ISBN: 978-1-907256-69-1.) The Incas lived in this land of violent contrasts. In Inca Land one may pass within a few hours from alpine landscapes of snow and glaciers to tropical, humid settings, lush with tree ferns. The story of the Incas is still in a maze of doubt and contradiction. It was this mystery and the romance of nineteenth-century exploration that first led Bingham into the relatively unknown interior of ancient Peru, the Land of the Incas. In the very last paragraph of let, in a throw-away sentence, Bingham writes, \".......until someone explores the present village of Vilcabamba and its vicinity....\" Little did he know when he wrote those words in 1909 that a mere two years later he would be the expedition leader that explored this region sometimes called 'the Cradle of the Incas'\".

An absurdity. You could hang me over the door of a pawnshop\"), is a painter of some renown and a petty thief who has never before been caught and steals only for pleasure. Both art and the art of thievery have been part of his \"endless effort at possession,\" but now he's pushing fifty, feels like a hundred, and things have not been going so well.

The breath is enough to carry you the distance it takes to fly to the moon and return in one long winter night. I have been looking for the return of such a poet. Joan Kane crafts poems as meticulous as snowflakes. She is visionary and the poems carry this vision with solid grace.\" Joy Harjo\n\"These poems are original, unsentimental, plain, and mysterious. There is something of Lorine Niedecker's Wisconsin, and something of Willa Cather's Nebraska or New Mexico in Joan Kane's Alaska. And something more, \"on the border of speech,\" which yet gives us a new sense -- or maybe retrieves an old sense-- of experience. Sometimes, in these poems, description, and what we cannot quite find words for, underneath it, are enough; in fact, more than we would have known how to ask for: a lost people -- a shaman's voice -- the voice of a glacier -- of a shell? 'In a room in which you're found at every margin / Forgetting you is nothing but a long discipline.'\" Jean Valentine\nThese poems are much more than verbal constructs, though their language alone is enough to keep you reading. Joan Kane's mind spends much time with itself; her eye sees itself as part of the landscape, which in this collection is meticulously rendered, 'a bewilderment of white.' She does not find metaphors for life in the wilderness, but rather observes patterns of nature that life bears out. Hers is a voice without cultural or self-reference, a voice without verbal-technics -- as rare and stark as the main climatic idiosyncrasy of these poems, 'a year of two winters.'\" Priscilla Becker","Ellen and her fellow survivors abandon Phoenix and venture into the desert hoping to locate a Titan II missile silo, which may provide them with some semblance of safety from the beasts now marauding the planet.

For more than thirty years from 1923 he was an indefatigable fiction reviewer for periodicals including the Spectator and Saturday Review. His first book, Night Fears(1924) was a collection of short stories; but it was not until the publication of Eustace and Hilda(1947), which won the James Tait Black prize, that Hartley gained widespread recognition as an author. His other novels include The Go-Between(1953), which was adapted into an internationally-successful film starring Julie Christie and Alan Bates, and The Hireling (1957), the film version of which won the Palme d'Orat the Cannes Film Festival.\nIf you enjoyed The Go-Between, you might like Barry Hines's A Kestrel for a Knave, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.\n'Magical and disturbing'\nIndependent \n'On a first reading, it is a beautifully wrought description of a small boy's loss of innocence long ago.

It situates us in space, in relation to the luminosity of objects, art, and one another. That every shadow of wonder can stand forth in the most familiar words is the gift this poet offers his readers time and again. - Susan Howe Praise for Burt Kimmelman's Earlier Poetry \"A rare evocation . . . the wonder of this world in itself.\" - Robert Creeley \"Artful, fastidious, learned . . . I am delighted by so much feeling for style.\" - Alfred Kazin \"A strict & powerful accounting, leaving me - for one - filled with admiration & hooked on every word.\" - Jerome Rothenberg \"Form calls deeply to form, as though the works ... lifted one to the very brim of language....\" - Michael Heller \"Few contemporary poets so gracefully demonstrate classic notions of what the practice of poetry must be.\" - Madeline Tiger, Jacket \"Exceptionally intelligent and necessary . . .\" -- Ed Foster, Poetry Project Newsletter \"His confidence lies with the poem itself, that he has found it (or that it has found him)....\" - Norman Finkelstein, The Offending Adam \"[In Kimmelman's poems] the arts restate the questions we have been asking and the ways they clean and stretch our questions reward us more than answers would.\" - William Bronk \"As quiet an experience as anyone could wish for.\" - Cid Corman \"He finds what is luminously transcendent....\" - Harvey Shapiro \"Worth our own best attention. \" - John Taggart \"Attains 'the simple ... facts'.\" - Samuel Menashe \"A verse so delicate and so far from insistence....\" - Karl Young, Light & Dust \"Kimmelman's quiet poems contain the luminescence of perception, its lure, its beauty, its Zen of breath, tracing beauty in the pulse of the extant.\" -Star Black \"Kimmelman's poems attest to the simple majesties of being, the massive implications of the everyday.\" - Eric Hoffman, Rain Taxi","Throughout history, people in general have had a hard time accepting new ideas or unusual theories, or anything contrary to modern orthodox thought. Whether it is the stubbornness of man, angry at something he doesn't know--or understand--or his hatred towards things that are new, foreign or unprofitable, the results can often be disastrous.\nFor example, Philo Farnsworth, born in 1906, invented the television, contributing to the designs that are visible in shops today. When the president of RCA offered to buy his patents for $100,000, Farnworth refused. Consequently, a long and lengthy legal battle ensued with RCA and others seeking his patents, which ultimately led to his belongings being repossessed; the IRS locking him out of his lab for unpaid taxes; depression; alcohol abuse; and, finally, death from pneumonia on March 11, 1971.\nAnother example is Galileo, an Italian astronomer, engineer and philosopher whose theories were at odds with the authorities of his time. In Rome, 1615 AD, the \"Roman Inquisition\" tried him and found him \"vehemently suspect of heresy.\" Once they forced Galileo to recant, he was forced to spend the rest of his life under house arrest until his death in1642.\nIn the same way, not much has changed with medical \"heretics\" who dare to question the status quo of traditional medical thought.\nIn \"The History of New Innovations in Modern Medicine\" this same \"reign of terror\" is exposed, involving the medical munity going all the way back to the time of Galen in 200 AD. Even then, in antiquity, Galen was run out of town for ing into conflict with local, jealous physicians.\nThe same thing happened to Dr. Wilheim Kolff, the inventor of the dialysis machine. His invention was considered an \"abomination\" and professionals mocked him as a \"rogue\". Kolff's artificial kidney went on to save millions of lives.\nDr. William Harvey, who discovered the actual way that blood circulates in the body totally reversed the traditional English theory of blood circulation in opposition to 1500 years of medical theory founded by the Greek physician Galen. Harvey was considered an enemy by all traditional medical practitioners alive during his lifetime. He was viciously attacked by critics who believed in the theories of Galen. Without Harvey's discovery we would have no idea how the heart helps circulate the blood, and there would be no cardiovascular medicine as we know it today.\nAnd the list goes on and on. Hopefully, the exposure of this syndrome of intolerance and fear of the new shown in , and understanding what causes it, will help influence more people to accept the next important innovation in modern medicine.","After cheating on and losing the man he loved, Morgan Conway decided to get his life right.

Our beloved converts have e to love the Church as their mother and home. They have prayed, argued, studied, and finally embraced the Catholic faith. But it wasn't by their works alone that they have found a home in the Church. Ultimately they--like all Catholics--are members of the Church because of God's generous gift of faith, which we neither earn nor deserve. May these converts, and all like them, persevere in their newfound faith and bear fruit a hundredfold. -Most Rev. Michael J. Sheehan Archbishop, Archdiocese of Santa Fe We like to hear others talk in glowing terms about someone we love. We take delight in gaining new appreciation of that person by seeing him through the eyes of others. And if still others want to praise that person, we will not stop them by saying we have already heard all the good things we need to hear. Though volumes of convert stories have appeared in recent years, we who love the Catholic Church never tire of reading about how still others have allowed themselves to be led by the Holy Spirit into the Church. We know the next one we read will give us a fresh look at the Church through that person's eyes. Curious or even critical non-Catholics will find much food for thought in these testimonies. Each convert travels a unique road. One of our contributors reminds us of this by quoting Venerable John Henry Newman, the most distinguished of all Catholic converts since Augustine. Newman pointed out that the Catholic Church \"presents herself very differently to different minds who are contemplating her from without. God deals with them differently, but, if they are faithful to their light, at last, in their own time, though it may be a different time to each, he brings them to that one and the same state of mind, very definite and not to be mistaken, which we call conviction.\" -Fr.

The Evolution of Everythingis about bottom-up order and its enemy, the top-down twitch--the endless fascination human beings have for design rather than evolution, for direction rather than emergence.\nDrawing on anecdotes from science, economics, history, politics and philosophy, Matt Ridley's wide-ranging, highly opinionated opus demolishes conventional assumptions that major scientific and social imperatives are dictated by those on high, whether in government, business, academia, or morality. On the contrary, our most important achievements develop from the bottom up. Patterns emerge, trends evolve. Just as skeins of geese form Vs in the sky without meaning to, and termites build mud cathedrals without architects, so brains take shape without brain-makers, learning can happen without teaching and morality changes without a plan. Although we neglect, defy and ignore them, bottom-up trends shape the world. The growth of technology, the sanitation-driven health revolution, the quadrupling of farm yields so that more land can be released for nature--these were largely emergent phenomena, as were the Internet, the mobile phone revolution, and the rise of Asia. Ridley demolishes the arguments for design and effectively makes the case for evolution in the universe, morality, genes, the economy, culture, technology, the mind, personality, population, education, history, government, God, money, and the future. As pelling as it is controversial, authoritative as it is ambitious, Ridley's stunning perspective will revolutionize the way we think about our world and how it works.","When a luxurious residence is built on the Jeddah waterfront not far from young Tarek's neighbourhood, Tarek and his friends dream of employment in the palace to escape their world of petty crime and unrelenting cruelty.

To make sure that the account covers British and American, as well as French and European, history, an English-speaking historian joins the French author. The approach is ecumenical, covering with good balance the full range of denominational developments in the Western church and its missionary outreach . . .

Climate change is only the most visible of the modifications we've made--up until this point, inadvertently--to the planet. And our current behavior threatens not only our own future but that of countless other creatures. By paring Earth's story to those of other planets, astrobiologist David Grinspoon shows what a strange and novel development it is for a species to evolve to build machines, and ultimately, global societies with world-shaping influence.\nWithout minimizing the challenges of the next century, Grinspoon suggests that our present moment is not only one of peril, but also great potential, especially when viewed from a 10,000-year perspective. Our species has surmounted the threat of extinction before, thanks to our innate ingenuity and ability to adapt, and there's every reason to believe we can do so again.\nOur challenge now is to awaken to our role as a force of planetary change, and to grow into this task. We must bee graceful planetary engineers, conscious shapers of our environment and caretakers of Earth's biosphere. This is a perspective that begs us to ask not just what future do we want to avoid, but what do we seek to build? What kind of world do we want? Are humans the worst thing or the best thing to ever happen to our planet? Today we stand at a pivotal juncture, and the answer will depend on the choices we make.","What if the Japanese had developed an atomic bomb at the end of World War II? And one was still around?

But when Lake intercepts an act of terror on the Golden Gate Bridge, he ignites an incredible hunt; a race against time, betrayal and an enemy more dangerous than Lake or his handlers could guess.","A prehensive, practical book for New Zealand property investors and managers.\nWorking Landlord, Happy Tenants is a hands-on guide for typical New Zealand landlords - people who are in employment but also want to manage their own properties.

Losing her parents to death at the fragile age of ten years, she kept afloat with unbelievably stoic wherewithal, always hanging on to her one true belief in God. Rather than being placed into an orphanage, she was taken in by a well-to-do Aunt and Uncle in France where she was afforded the best life could offer. Madeleine never took for granted the privileges that had been so favorably bestowed upon her. A blessed marriage and beautiful daughter fulfilled her every dream until the second world war changed life forever. There was only one thing that could bring Madeleine happiness once again. Would she ever find it?\nNext, meet Lilly, Madeleine's daughter, born into a family of wealth and influence in northern France in the year 1925. At the tender age of fourteen years, Lilly was sent underground to avoid probable capture and death by the Nazis during WWII. During this grueling period of time in life Lilly faced the unfathomable challenge of merely staying alive. Following three years spent in desolate living quarters her strong faith and fervent prayers provided her an out, saving her life. While remaining underground in a new location for an additional two years, Lilly found the love of her life and a job that kept her afloat until the war's end. Life with her new love, Valentin, is filled with suspense and excitement as they pave their way through unknown territories from continent to continent, discovering a world full of purpose for every living being on earth.\nLast but certainly not least, meet Lorraine, Lilly's sister-in-law, born in the late 1920's near Krakow, Poland into a dirt poor family as well. Her parents' merciless killings by the German Gestapo in 1939 painfully placed herself and two younger sisters into life-threatening situations. Lorraine, at thirteen years of age, found herself the new mother of eight and nine year old siblings. Tossed into a rail car heading to the Baltic Sea by a well meaning neighbor, he hoped to save them from likely death. The trials and tribulations faced by these young girls were, at times, unspeakable. Yet, with God as their protector, they were led into the hands of servants in a monastery on the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. Having lost their parents to death and being separated from four siblings, with no knowledge of their whereabouts, the girls lived as a unit together in an orphanage for several years. In their young adult lives, they would face separation once again, but not forever.\nEvery challenge these women faced was eased by their strong Christian convictions. Faith and hope traveled alongside them from tragedy to triumph. From Europe to America, they were guided to plentiful opportunities the melting pot of the world had to offer in the 1950's. Their lives intertwined with the joys and sorrows of extended family along with other emigrants seeking new lives in the United States.\nA pelling story of appreciation in all they received, along with the perseverance undeniably required to rise above their losses, provides readers with encouragement and assurance for a better life.\nContinued travels throughout America and Europe provide these exceptional women, these pillars of strength, with many pleasures and continuous reminders that this is only a temporary stop in our spiritual lives, experienced within the human realm.\n.","From Publishers Weekly\nCheeky, irreverent and playfully ingenuous, this abbreviated history of democracy is everything one would expect from the writers of Comedy Central's fake news program, which recently (and somewhat scandalously) won the Television Critics Association's award for outstanding news and public affairs series. The book is laid out like a textbook, with \"Discussion Questions\" (\"Why do you think the Framers made the Constitution so soul-crushingly boring?\"), \"Classroom Activities\" (\"Using felt and yarn, make a hand puppet of Clarence Thomas. Ta-da! You're Antonin Scalia!\") and plenty of amusing graphics, including a board game that resembles the game Life but which follows a presidential term: \"Optimistic press release on economy ineffective. Spin again.\" No one evades the authors' scrutiny, not even the Pilgrims, who came to America \"to escape religious persecution... create a society where they could worship as they pleased and one day, God willing, even do some persecuting of their own.\" The media fares the worst, however. An entire chapter is devoted to telling the \"inspirational\" story of how the media \"transformed itself from a mere public necessity into an entertaining profit center for ever-expanding corporate empires.\" But if this and other criticisms  a few unpatriotic feelings, a section describing how worse off the rest of the world is should buoy spirits. From its dedication (\"To the huddled masses--Keep yearnin'!\") to its final chapter, which lampoons the 2004 presidential candidates, this humorous sendup of American politics never fails to entertain, poke fun and provoke thought.\nCopyright (c) Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In biblical and rabbinic literature, the obligation to love God appears as a formal mandment. Yet most people today think of love as a feeling. How can an emotion be manded? How could one ever fulfill such a requirement? The Love of God places these scholarly and existential questions in a new light.\nJon Levenson traces the origins of the concept to the ancient institution of covenant, showing how covenantal love is a matter neither of sentiment nor of dry legalism. The love of God is instead a deeply personal two-way relationship that finds expression in God's mysterious love for the people of Israel, who in turn observe God's laws out of profound gratitude for his acts of deliverance. Levenson explores how this bond has survived episodes in which God's love appears to be painfully absent--as in the brutal persecutions of Talmudic times--and describes the intensely erotic portrayals of the relationship by biblical prophets and rabbinic interpreters of the Song of Songs. He examines the love of God as a spiritual discipline in the Middle Ages as well as efforts by two influential modern Jewish thinkers--Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig--to recover this vital but endangered aspect of their tradition.\nA breathtaking work of scholarship and spirituality alike that is certain to provoke debate, The Love of God develops fascinating insights into the foundations of religious life in the classical Jewish tradition.","A clear, concise explanation of human nature; the worlds of body, soul, and spirit; the laws of reincarnation; and the workings of karma.\nTheosophyis a key work for gaining a solid footing in spiritual reality as described by Rudolf Steiner. It is organized into four parts. First, Steiner builds a prehensive understanding of human nature: physical bodily nature; soul qualities; spirit being, or I-being; and the higher spiritual aspects. This leads us to Steiner's description of the human being as sevenfold:\n-Material, physical body\n-Ether body, or body of life forces\n-Sentient soul body\n-Mind soul\n-Spirit-filled consciousness soul\n-Life spirit\n-Spirit body\nIn the next section, Steiner offers an extraordinary overview of the laws of reincarnation and the principles of karma, as we pass from one life to the next. This prepares us for the third section, in which he shows the various ways in which we live--during life on earth and after death and in the three worlds of body, soul, and spirit.\nFinally, we are given a succinct description of the path of knowledge, along which each person can begin to understand the marvelous and harmonious plexity of the psycho-spiritual worlds in their fullness.","What would you do if you had two hot men fight over you?\nAn orphan at the age of seven, there was one thing that Sienna Richards didn't do easily--give her heart.

For fall 2001, M&S is proud to present the equally stunning and prehensive second volume of this landmark work.\nThis fall, on consecutive Sunday evenings starting on September 30, the CBC will broadcast eight new episodes from its spectacular - and spectacularly successful - series Canada: A People's History.\nVolume Two opens with the rebellion over property and language rights for the French-speaking Metis in Manitoba, led by the charismatic and troubled Louis Riel - a key event in our history and one that haunts us to this day.

The second year of the series and the second volume of the book are both now poised to rocket to even greater success in 2001.\nFrom the Hardcover edition.","Finally flushed into the open by the heroism of a joker and an uninfected lady reporter, the Card Shark conspiracy faces destruction.

Indeed the discipline of archaeology would be impossible without the survival of such artifacts. What is the implication of the durability or ephemerality of past material culture for the reproduction of societies in the past?

He uses the topic of memory to critique the treatment of artifacts as symbols by interpretative archaeologists and artifacts as units of information (or memes) by behavioral archaeologists, instead arguing for a treatment of artifacts as forms of mnemonic trace that have an impact on the senses. Using detailed case studies from prehistoric Europe, he further argues that archaeologists can study the relationship between mnemonic traces in the form of networks of reference in artifactual and architectural forms.","Meet Thomas Kyd, private investigator.\nHe's the guy who picks up the cases that Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe didn't stick around to handle.\n'Maybe if I'd followed my real impulses towards Laura Cassidy, a tragedy could have been averted.

This collection contains 31 short pieces that are among his personal favorites. Two sections contain his series stories, the ``Black Widower'' and the ``Union Club'' mysteries. Brief introductions to each section and story will serve to acquaint readers with the general background of the series. A third section contains miscellaneous mysteries. All are clear and entertaining. This is a book to be read on ``a little here, a little there'' basis. The stories are short, and prolonged reading results in a series of mental stops and starts that are wearying. Also, the stories are written according to a set formula. However, read on the installment plan, the book is worth the effort. If the recent spate of series in juvenile publishing is any guide, this collection should please adolescents, including reluctant readers.\n- School Library Journal","I'm a professional mourner.

Rostovtzeff","Most people know Roald Dahl as a famous writer of children's books and adult short stories, but few are aware of his fascination with medicine. Right from his earliest days to the end of his life, Dahl was intrigued by what doctors do, and why they do it.\nDuring his lifetime, he and his family suffered some terrible medical tragedies: Dahl nearly died when his fighter plane went down in World War II; his son had a severe brain injury in an accident, and his daughter died of measles infection of the brain. But he also had some medical triumphs: he dragged himself back to health after the plane crash, despite a skull fracture, back injuries, and blindness; he was responsible for inventing a medical device (the Wade-Dahl-Till valve) to treat his son's hydrocephalus (water on the brain), and he taught his first wife Patricia to talk again after a devastating stroke. His medical interactions clearly influenced some of his writing - for example, the explosive potions in George's Marvellous Medicine. And sometimes his writing impacted on events in his life - for example, the research on neuroanatomy he did for his short story William and Mary later helped him design the valve for treating hydrocephalus.\nIn this unique book, Professor Tom Solomon, who looked after Dahl towards the end of his life, examines Dahl's fascination with medicine.","The \"fascinating\" (The New Yorker) story of Athanasius Kircher, the eccentric scholar-inventor who was either a great genius or a crackpot... or a bit of both.\nThe interests of Athanasius Kircher, the legendary seventeenth-century priest-scientist, knew no bounds.

A Man of Misconceptions traces the rise, success, and eventual fall of this fascinating character as he attempted to e to terms with a changing world.\nWith humor and insight, John Glassie returns Kircher to his rightful place as one of history's most unforgettable figures.\nA Scientific AmericanBest Science Book of 2012\nAn Atlantic Wire Best Book of 2012\nA New York Times Book Review\"Editor's Choice\"","The tiny village of Lusty in Ireland is home to far more secrets than it is people.\nAwkward city-girl, Ellie, is the last to be picked in every aspect of her life.

It was written from the states of mind that prevail upon a man who has driven himself to the edges of society. It's a book that's been lived in. The carpets are rucked up, a lot of thinking happened in this room. Someone flirted with madness in here, valued despair almost as much as joy. Stood alone for years before even thinking of return. It is a disturbing book, brutally honest, eccentric, frequently funny if you have a slightly deranged sense of humour, and peaceful in a strange sort of way. A clash of worlds. Metaphysical, and ordinary. A sparsely furnished room, and outer space. A falling away of everything. Childhood ransacked for moments of understanding from the distance of age. Playfulness with words. The beauty of language and what it can say when you don't try too hard to force it into market-acceptable forms.\nWorld of Dust is a story shattered into fragments waiting to be picked up in matching pieces. It is a philosophy in sudden shafts of sunlight out of dark clouds. It is also, proudly, a book about nothing.","Jane runs away from Life House, a facility for kids with mental health disorders and addictions.

Just a bottle made of bevelled glass: small, and coated with a silver lacquer that had flaked off in places, not enough to reveal its contents. The cork stopper was crumbling, but tightly wedged in. There was something looped around its neck with string; a stained label, coiled with damp. Kitty reached past me and hooked it out. A mouldering smell reached my nose as she unfurled the label. '\"They say there be a witch inside it,'\" she read. '\"And if you let her out, there'll be a peck of trouble.\"' She let the paper spring back and grinned the grin that I loved. The grin that usually meant she was about to do something reckless.

Why are they not mating? What scent have they caught on the wind? Why do these wolves seem... different?\nIt won't be long before they discover the terrible truth...\nExcerpt:\nThe howl turned to a yell, cracking halfway as the vocal cords shifted, and the alpha came, his screams echoing around the clearing. As soon as he'd filled Emily with his seed he fell to the side, sliding out of her ravaged pussy to collapse beside her. Aylen stared in shock. He was human, it was undeniable. The fur remained across the chest and back, thinner but still coarse, and the hair on his head was a long, greasy mane, but apart from that he looked entirely human.\nHowls erupted from the edge of the clearing, and in the darkness Aylen could make out the shifting shapes of the other wolves. They began to prowl from the darkness into the moonlight, both men and women, all of them muscular and powerful. They walked like... well, like wolves. Aylen knew each of them intimately, and she thought she could identify them by the way they moved around the clearing.\nOne woman, tall and rangy with dark, dirty hair and a pert, luscious ass prowled around the center, her eyes never leaving Emily and the alpha. She was the alpha female, Aylen realized, and she'd been cheated from her prize. The alpha male lazily lifted his head and growled a warning, and she backed away a few steps before holding her ground. The male rose to his feet and stood firm, a low growl rumbling from his throat, and then he turned quickly, lifted Emily easily with one hand and threw her over his shoulder. Without another sound he was gone from the clearing, and Emily with him.\nToo late, Aylen understood her problem. When the alpha had fucked Emily he'd made her the new alpha female. The old alpha had fallen in rank, and Aylen herself... well, she was nothing. Fair game. She hid behind the rock, trying to make herself smaller. The other wolves knew she was there, but maybe they'd be preoccupied with their own kind in the mating frenzy that was beginning. If she stayed silent she may have the chance to creep from the clearing while the wolves were lost in their private bliss. She just had to -\nthe first wolf attacked. The man landed heavily on her back, pushing her down against the rock with his powerful arms, pinning her to the cold stone as he yanked her ski pants down to her knees. She yelled in shock and pain as he forced his way inside her. His cock was enormous, and this time it was already erect. Aylen's nose was filled with the musky scent of his sweat, and she felt his searing breath on the back of her neck as he forced her against the rock. He fucked her feverishly, hard and fast, and it was only moments before she felt the first jet of hot cum spurt into her pussy. She never even saw her attacker. By the time she caught her breath and turned around he'd melted back into the pack.\nAylen shook with fear. She felt hot cum dripping down her inner thighs, and she knew her body was sending out signals that every member of the pack could sense. She tried to back against the rock to block attackers from the rear, but as she turned she saw four men staring at her body. Their sharp yellow eyes bore into her, and their lips gleamed as they snarled with hunger.","Antligen ar den har, den fjarde romanen i Johan Theorins Olandssvit!\nSolen steker den kalkvita on, men semesterparadiset doljer morka hemligheter.\n\"Spokskeppet kom glidande i morkret, over blankande svart vatten, och vajde inte for nagot eller nagon.

But they kept but one--They promised to take our land...and they took it.\" - Oglala Lakota Chief Red Cloud\nFrom the \"Trail of Tears\" to Wounded Knee and Little Bighorn, the narrative of American history is inplete without the inclusion of the Native Americans that lived on the continent before European settlers arrived in the 16th and 17th centuries. Since the first contact between natives and settlers, tribes like the Sioux, Cherokee, and Navajo have both fascinated and perplexed outsiders with their history, language, and culture. In Charles River Editors' Native American Tribes series, readers can get caught up to speed on the history and culture of North America's most famous native tribes in the time it takes to finish a mute, while learning interesting facts long forgotten or never known.\nAmong Native American tribes, the Sioux are one of the best known and most important. Participants in some of the most famous and notorious events in American history, the history of the Sioux is replete with constant reminders of the consequences of both their acmodation of and resistance to American incursions into their territory by pioneering white settlers pushing further westward during the 19th century. Some Sioux leaders and their bands resisted ining whites, while others tried to acmodate them, but the choice often had little impact on the ultimate oute. Crazy Horse, who was never defeated in battle by U.S. troops, surrendered to them in 1877, only to be bayoneted to death by soldiers attempting to imprison him. Black Kettle, who flew a large American flag from his lodge to indicate his friendship with the white man, was shot to death by soldiers under George Custer's mand in 1868.\nThroughout the 19th century, the U.S. government and its officials in the West adopted a policy of dividing the Sioux into two groups: \"Treaty Indians\" and \"Non-treaty Indians.\" Often they used these groups against each other or used one group to influence another, but the end was always the same. They were forced off the land where they resided, their populations were decimated by disease, and they were forced onto reservations to adopt lifestyles considered \"appropriate\" by American standards.\nDespite being some of the most erstwhile foes the U.S. government faced during the Indian Wars, the Sioux and their most famous leaders were grudgingly admired and eventually immortalized by the very people they fought. Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse remain household names due to their leadership of the Sioux at the fateful Battle of the Little Bighorn, where the native warriors wiped out much of George Custer's 7th Cavalry and inflicted the worst defeat of the Indian Wars upon the U.S. Army. Red Cloud remains a symbol of both defiance and conciliation, resisting the Americans during Red Cloud's War but also transitioning into a more peaceful life for decades on reservation.\nNative American Tribes: The History and Culture of the Sioux prehensively covers the culture and history of the Sioux, profiling their origins, their famous leaders, and their lasting legacy. Along with pictures of important people, places, and events, you will learn about the Sioux like you never have before, in no time at all.","Finbar Black's day is turned upside down when a crazy, beautiful girl bursts into the house with a gun and a bag full of cash.

He takes us into the secret world of \"Survivor\" Spoilers, where avid internet users pool their knowledge to unearth the show's secrets before they are revealed on the air. He introduces us to young \"Harry Potter\" fans who are writing their own Hogwarts tales while executives at Warner Brothers struggle for control of their franchise. He shows us how \"The Matrix\" has pushed transmedia storytelling to new levels, creating a fictional world where consumers track down bits of the story across multiple media channels.Jenkins argues that struggles over convergence will redefine the face of American popular culture. Industry leaders see opportunities to direct content across many channels to increase revenue and broaden markets. At the same time, consumers envision a liberated public sphere, free of network controls, in a decentralized media environment. Sometimes corporate and grassroots efforts reinforce each other, creating closer, more rewarding relations between media producers and consumers. Sometimes these two forces are at war.\nJenkins provides a riveting introduction to the world where every story gets told and every brand gets sold across multiple media platforms. He explains the cultural shift that is occurring as consumers fight for control across disparate channels, changing the way we do business, elect our leaders, and educate our children.","Where would humanity be without fire, farming, or wine?

In Hellenistic Egypt, the Egyptian god Thoth was given as epithet the Greek name of Hermes. He has also been identified with Enoch. Other similar syncretized gods include Serapis and Hermanubis.\nHermes Trismegistus might also be explained in Euhemerist fashion as a man who was the son of the god, and in the Kabbalistic tradition that was inherited by the Renaissance, it could be imagined that such a personage had been contemporary with Moses, municating to a line of adepts a parallel wisdom, from Zoroaster to Plato.

The Goths are thus of unique importance in our evaluation of the kinds of changes that these migrations worked upon the tribal neighbours of the Roman empire, as well as upon the Roman empire itself. This volume brings together many of the most important historical texts, the majority of them (speeches of Themistius, the Passion of St Saba, and evidence relating to the life and work of Ulfila) not previously available in English translation. Also included are representative selections, with mentary, from the Gothic New Testament, and, with ample illustration, from the so-called Sintana de Mures/Chernjachov culture associated with Gothic occupation of the transDanubian regions in the third and fourth centuries. Taken as a whole, these sources throw much light upon the political, social, and religious organisation of the Goths, and on the nature of their relations with the Roman state in the period before their fateful crossing of the Danube in 376.","Nasty Nick - the man everybody loves to hate.

Proceed beyond this point at your own risk.\nWhen celebrated Omicron detective Ferrix Vaughn is called in to investigate a deadly breach on Hesperidia, a protected planet full of indigenous wildlife, he doesn't know what to expect. The place used to be a tourist attraction, but the safari tours were discontinued long ago due to rampant poaching.

The Blyths adopted her from a kindly old woman connected to a traveling circus, but everyone knew she wasn't from circus folk. All they DID know about her identity was that she'd lost her hearing in an accident, and the proprietor of the circus had treated her horribly, and, and . . . and in her cache of secret personal private things, she owned one thing as precious to her as life itself: a bracelet made of brown human hair with the initials MG tied into it. The Blyths kept it locked in a bureau for fear that Mary's unknown family might one day claim her. . . .","Capon has a clear sense of the job expected of him. Not only does he participate in the acute authorial self-consciousness found generally in 20th century novels, he also recognizes the extra onus of trying to make living, breathing, experiential sense of life-in-Christ rather than of life-in-general. He sees his basic fictional problem as that of establishing a direct & authentic tone of voice that will engage readers & carry them into & along with the course of the story. The chosen mode of presentation is 1st person narration: the persona is a perceptive, experienced man in his fifties who is intimately involved in the events he relates.\nCapon makes his novel turn on the mystery of a single human personality. The mystery is particularized in central figures who are men in their mid-thirties (Christ-bearers?). He uses as the mainspring of his plot a death--specifically, a violent death--to force his theological questions & the need for mensurate answers to the fore. It's obvious, then, why the choice of a 1st person narrator was made.\nThe atmosphere of Capon's Exit 36 is, oppressively & aggressively, that of Long Island suburbia. The narrator is an Episcopal priest who makes no bones about belonging to this freeway-&-shopping-center, banal, fortable, TV-family-edy way of life & thriving in it, talking its lingo & living by its rhythms. He saves his self-respect by pouring it on for the theology class he's been retained to teach on Saturdays at a nearby seminary. Otherwise he is, as he introduces himself, Bill Jansson, an easy-going, extrovertive, life-affirming regular guy. The pages of Exit 36 race with Jansson's embracing love of self & others, mingling wit, slang, up-to-the-minute four letter words, big theological generalizations & a rueful awareness now & then that he's rarely the persuader & mainstay that he'd like to be. (Is Capon flirting breezily with some ic self-portraiture in Jansson?)\nThe subject of Exit 36 is the suicide of a 38-year-old Episcopal priest from the parish next to Jansson's. Ted Jacobs died by driving his car at full speed into an abutment at Exit 36, Sunnyside Blvd, Northern State Pkwy. The novel unfolds as the revelation of Jacobs' all-too-human errors & ineffectualities, which center in his four-year-long \"double life\" as not merely a gentle idealist & leftwing activist, a model of pastoral care, & a passable husband to Anne but also as the tortured & magnetized lover of Pat, a desirable divorcee who lives in Jansson's parish. Jansson's self-appointed mission is to bring the two women to accept the truth about Ted, & their own separate yet somehow mutual relations to him, without repudiating their love for him or their potential respect for each other. This is what Jansson calls \"reconciliation\"-\"One Main Subject: God, it is just so obvious!\" (p.81)\nUnfortunately, it's Capon's treatment of Xianity as \"so obvious,\" so open to brash paraphrase, so approachable in over-familiar or trendy terms, that precludes any achievement of human authenticity or religious vision in his novel. Exit 36 simply begs its ultimate questions instead of confronting them directly. Mod-pop God-talk may be acceptable to that segment of his readership for whom he's a preacher to the converted. But those readers who judge him as a novelist will see their time & money as having pretty largely been wasted.--Janel M.

How has he e to disregard the sanctity of human life? What have they done to influence his character? Where have they failed him? Duncan's guilt is self-confessed, but no explained. Everything in their world has changed.\nThe parents and Duncan find themselves in the hands of flamboyant Senior Counsel Hamilton Motsamai, a black advocate returned from exile and now, in a country freed from racial discrimination, a distinguished member of the legal profession. It is also a country in which the death penalty is being challenged as invalid under the country's new constitution, but it is still on the statute book.\nThe House Gun is a passionate narrative of that final test of human relations we call love - between lovers of all kinds and parents and their offspring. It moves with the restless pace of living itself, from the intimate to the general condition; if it is a parable of present violence, it is also an affirmation of the will to human reconciliation that starts where it must, between individual men and women.","Drawing on art, artifacts, and literature that was left behind, these richly illustrated volumes recount captivating tales of everyday life in long-ago vanished worlds.","Wele to New York City's Upper East Side, where my friends and I live, go to school, play, and sleep--sometimes with each other.\nS is back from boarding school, and if we aren't careful, she's going to win over our teachers, wear that dress we couldn't fit into, steal our boyfriends' hearts, and basically ruin our lives in a major way.

The remainder of the book, 35 selections from across the works of Goodwin, displays Goodwins constant attention to Christ in his various theological engagements. You will learn much about the life and works of this influential Puritan, and perhaps, be strengthened with a habitual sight of Christ. Endorsement In the long line of distinguished Puritans known as the Spiritual Brotherhood, Thomas Goodwin had a formative impact on a host of contemporaries, including John Owen. On many a day while writing my doctoral dissertation on Goodwin, I found myself overwhelmed with emotion as well as penetrating insight as this servant of God set Christ forth in His saving office. Thomas Goodwins work defies any tidy division between doctrine and doxology. - Mike Horton","\"Makes a terrific and enriching addition to any life-science course and a charming gateway into deeper discussions of the body.\" -- SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL\nHave you ever wondered what some of your body parts do?

Every story guides the reader through a brief journey and the end result is the discovery of a new dish. In each one we've put our emotions, our feelings and our fondness for the person or people after whom the recipes are named. They are family members; friends whom we met during our chorus lessons, where music reigns supreme; people who have attended the cooking lessons we organize, where the joy of cooking and baking is abundant; and people whom we have met in our daily life. So many family members, friends and acquaintances... countless personal feelings have been laid bare. We are not chefs, we are not writers, nor are we professional musicians. We just love cooking, books, music and people. We decided to embark on this literary adventure one day when we were putting Cristiana's huge collection of recipes on the puter. She had been collecting them for years, every recipe was connected to a person or moment in her life, and there was an anecdote for each one. We decided then and there to bine them with the more recent ones and write stories in order to share with everyone the emotions and the fun that can be experienced while preparing and enjoying some of these dishes which are our favourites. At the same time we wanted to describe the personalities of the people we dedicated them to, people who at one time or another have had an impact on our lives.","The Fundamental Five: The Formula for Quality Instruction, shares with teachers and school leaders the five practices that every teacher can, and should, use to dramatically improve instuctional rigor and relevance, and student performance.","SALON TO BIENNIAL explores the development of modern art as shown through a series of highly influential group exhibitions.

Here he offers pelling answers to the eternal questions of identity, origin, and meaning. Chopra's thesis is that people rely on their senses to define their experience of reality -- limiting their experience of the material world and making them prisoners, out of touch with realities that lie beyond the material. He explains that there is no difference between observer and observed; it is all one shared experience. Realizing this truth, says Chopra, frees people from their sensory-created prison to experience a more nurturing and fulfilling life. The author's calm, uplifting voice gives these ideas heft and power, and his inclusion of relaxed guitar interludes let listeners pause to contemplate more deeply. Chopra expands the discussion by citing T. S. Eliot, Nietzsche, Rumi, Tagore, and Patanjali, as well as scientific experiments and spiritual texts.","This is a true story about sharing the value of an extended family Author Janie Riddle wrote  to encourage grandparents to help their grandchildren learn.

Is Paris Burning? reconstructs the network of fateful events that heralded one of the most dramatic episodes of our time. \"Is Paris burning\" screams the shrill voice of Adolf Hitler. At that moment, noon on August 25, 1944, advance elements of General Leclerc's Free French, supported by American infantry, were streaming across the bridges of the Seine. Their arrival was the climax of an extraordinary and fateful interplay of circumstances that saved the city, its population and its priceless treasures from Hitler's vengeful sentence of destruction and death. Few days in history have witnessed an emotional outpouring as overwhelming as that which acpanied the liberation of Paris. Yet few men then realized, or even now prehend, the miracle that had occurred; how narrowly all Paris had escaped being reduced to rubble and ashes. The whole story of that miracle is told for the 1st time here. It enpasses the explosion of events that involved Prussian generals and schoolboys of the Resistance, General de Gaulle impatiently forcing the hand of his reluctant American allies while he himself was desperately maneuvering to gain control of the French underground, and the ordinary people of Paris rising to throw off the Nazi occupation as an enraged Hitler vowed to leave the city \"nothing but a field of ruins\". Is Paris Burning? is the product of nearly 3 years of research, during which the authors studied hundreds of documents, transcripts of Resistance radio messages, 20-yr. old cables, microfilms of German military records seized after the war, the official archives of SHAEF, and the files of secret correspondence between de Gaulle, Churchill, Roosevelt, and Eisenhower. Is Paris Burning? interweaves the personal experiences of those who were in the forefront of the melee and those who were behind the scenes and brings vividly to life the impassioned days when Paris struggled for her life.","Everyone knows the story where the beautiful girl gets taken by a monster.\nThe one where the monster ends up being some poor tortured soul with a fucked up past.\nLove prevails, and then they live happily ever fucking after.\nWell, this is my story and it isn't a fairytale.\nI loved my monster too.\nBut that was before he took me.\nMy reality is dark.\nHis demons are darker.","M/M Paranormal Short Story Romance\nEthan was a fairly normal art student when a chance encounter at a campground near Poland, Maine, changes his life forever.

The resulting collection is a satisfying mix of tales by some of the state's most well-known and award-winning writers. Some of the pieces are true stories written by non-believers, while others are clearly fiction and can be funny, bittersweet, spooky, or sinister. All share Michigan as a setting, bringing history and a sense of place to the eerie collection.\nGhosts in these stories have a wide range of motivations and cause a variety of consequences.

Brought to the attention of the director Trevor Nunn by the actress Vanessa Redgrave (who has contributed a Foreword to this edition), \"this early work...changed our perception of a major writer and still packs a hefty political punch\" (London Independent). Written in 1938 and based on an actual newspaper story, the play follows the events of a prison atrocity which shocked the nation: convicts leading a hunger strike in a Pennsylvania prison were locked in a steam-heated cell and roasted to death. Williams later said: \"I have never written anything since that could pete with it in violence and horror.\" Its sympathetic treatment of black and homosexual characters may have kept the play unproduced in its own time. But its flashes of lyricism and pelling dialogue presage the great plays Williams has yet to write. Not About Nightingalesshows us the young playwright (for the first time using his signature \"Tennessee\") as a political writer, passionate about social injustice, and reflecting the plight of outcasts in Depression America. The stylistic influences of European Expressionism, radical American theatre of the 1930s, and popular film make it unique among the group of four early plays. Not About Nightingaleshas been edited by eminent Williams scholar Allean Hale, who has also provided an illuminating historical introduction.","A different kind of Frankenstein.\nEinna is a lot like other teenage girls, naive, idealistic, secretive, disobedient and interested in boys.

Like Napoleon he dared to do impossible things, and like Napoleon he was deeply troubled when he learned that not everyone admired him.\nHe was a man whose revolutionary passion and brilliance inspired a nation of millions to rebellion, whose influence spanned continents, whose flamboyant and formidable aura spawned Trotskyites from Petrograd to London.\nPayne penetrates the web of myth that for years has distorted the real Trotsky -- the man of boundless contradictions : a devoted family man, who abandoned his first wife; a civilized scholar with a pronounced streak of cruelty; an anti-imperialist who contemplated the conquest of India and schemed revolution in the U.S.; a man who never succeeded in reconciling his absolutism and his love of freedom.\nIn this pelling biography, Payne recreates the man in all his facets. He reveals Trotsky's inner seeds of self-destruction, his terrible errors, his excessive pride, his supreme contempt for others. He unravels power plays at the highest levels of the Russian government, the immense struggle between Stalin and Trotsky, the twisted path of international intrigue that led to Trotsky's political downfall and, ultimately, his death at the hands of a mysterious assassin.\n'The biographer of Lenin, Stalin ... can't miss with Trotsky, whose life is arresting in bare chronology ... and Payne pursues him through a breathless sequence ... the book cannot help but move fast' - Kirkus Reviews\n'The important things about Robert Payne are his sensitive, astute intelligence, his vast erudition, and his magic power over words' - The New York Times\n'Probably no author of this century has produced so many books at such a relatively high level of scholarship' - The Times\nRobert Payne (1911-1983) had over a hundred books published on a wide range of subjects during his lifetime. Critics raved about 'his vast erudition,' 'his magic power over words,' and that rare ability 'to capture the spiritual essence of his subject.' The Russian series, in particular 'The Life and Death of Lenin' and 'The Rise and Fall of Stalin', raised his reputation as biographer to enormous stature.\nEndeavour Press is the UK's leading independent digital publisher.

Under Edward Heath, the optimism of the Sixties had bee a distant memory. Now the headlines were dominated by strikes and blackouts, unemployment and inflation.

The best how-to manual ever published.\" -- Kevin Kelly, Cool Tools\nScott McCloud tore down the wall between high and low culture in 1993 with Understanding Comics, a massive ic book about ics, linking the medium to such diverse fields as media theory, movie criticism, and web design. In Reinventing Comics, McCloud took this to the next level, charting twelve different revolutions in how ics are generated, read, and perceived today. Now, in Making Comics, McCloud focuses his analysis on the art form itself, exploring the creation of ics, from the broadest principles to the sharpest details (like how to accentuate a character's facial muscles in order to form the emotion of disgust rather than the emotion of surprise.) And he does all of it in his inimitable voice and through his cartoon stand-in narrator, mixing dry humor and legitimate instruction. McCloud shows his reader how to master the human condition through word and image in a brilliantly minimalistic way. Both ic book devotees and the uninitiated will marvel at this journey into a once-underappreciated art form.","Gutsy and stubborn 24 year old Trinity Parker is more than thrilled when she lands a job in a top New York fashion store, crunching numbers in the back office.

She watched drug panies stray from their original mission of discovering and manufacturing useful drugs and instead bee vast marketing machines with unprecedented control over their own fortunes. She saw them gain nearly limitless influence over medical research, education, and how doctors do their jobs. She sympathized as the American public, particularly the elderly, struggled and incregly failed to meet spiraling prescription drug prices. Now, in this bold, hard-hitting new book, Dr. Angell exposes the shocking truth of what the pharmaceutical industry has bee-and argues for essential, long-overdue change.\nCurrently Americans spend a staggering $200 billion each year on prescription drugs. As Dr. Angell powerfully demonstrates, claims that high drug prices are necessary to fund research and development are unfounded: The truth is that drug panies funnel the bulk of their resources into the marketing of products of dubious benefit. Meanwhile, as profits soar, the panies brazenly use their wealth and power to push their agenda through Congress, the FDA, and academic medical centers.\nZeroing in on hugely successful drugs like AZT (the first drug to treat HIV/AIDS), Taxol (the best-selling cancer drug in history), and the blockbuster allergy drug Claritin, Dr. Angell demonstrates exactly how new products are brought to market. Drug panies, she shows, routinely rely on publicly funded institutions for their basic research; they rig clinical trials to make their products look better than they are; and they use their legions of lawyers to stretch out government-granted exclusive marketing rights for years. They also flood the market with copycat drugs that cost a lot more than the drugs they mimic but are no more effective.\nThe American pharmaceutical industry needs to be saved, mainly from itself, and Dr. Angell proposes a program of vital reforms, which includes restoring impartiality to clinical research and severing the ties between drug panies and medical education. Written with fierce passion and substantiated with in-depth research, The Truth About the Drug Companiesis a searing indictment of an industry that has spun out of control.","You always hear about the moment right before the end when you see your life flash before your eyes.

Not until you're actually there, in that moment, that one moment just before the curtains of life are drawn closed after what bees your final act.\nI can tell you firsthand if that is true. I experienced it. Taking my bow as the curtains slowly closed. I reached out and tried to stop them, but I was helpless to stop it. It's weird, the roller coaster of emotions you go through when you've reached your journey's end.\nAs I lay on the cool tile, random thoughts ran through my mind.

The flashing of life or the whiteness of heaven? Not in the way people have made it sound, but I did see it. It served the purpose of showing me where it all went wrong.

They say it's twenty-twenty.\nThat's the truest statement I had ever heard.

The Immortals is different. This stunning first novel full of emotion addresses the truth of the female predicament -- the unsung heroes who are left behind on the homefront of war. We experience the love and challenges between husband and wife, we feel the closeness of mother and daughter, and we bond with the most unlikely of women. When we first meet Calli Coleman, a classically trained musician from a well-connected Baltimore family, it is the summer of 2005 and the United States has been at war in Iraq for two years. She has been uprooted from the hometown she adores and abruptly lands in the role of Army wife in provincial Sackets Harbor, New York outside of Fort Drum. Naive to all things military, Calli has no idea what's in store for her when Luke's infantry unit deploys to the Iraq War to an area CNN dubs \"The Triangle of Death\". Left back in New York with their three-year-old daughter Audrey, black Labrador Satchmo, and a fat cat named Charlemagne, Calli has a steep learning curve as she tumbles into a plicated social hierarchy where she finds her well-heeled childhood does her more harm than good. Desperately missing her friends and family and amid the impertinent Army wives, unlikely friendships evolve with Josie, Rachel, and Daphne. Seemingly as different from one another as can be, and certainly unlike her dynamic, jet-setting best friend Eula, these women will nonetheless e together for courage, support, and to embark upon the deeply emotional roller coaster ride of being an Army wife.\nWith only letters and email as their munication, Calli knows very little about Luke's mission in Iraq. Through their letters we get a beautiful picture of their love for each other and what it means to serve our Nation but Luke cannot share much about the confidential assignment. The news on the radio and television is never good. Calli dreads the phone ringing to tell her of more soldiers being blown up by IEDs or killed by gunfire and she fears \"The Trifecta\" - the casualty assistance officer, rear-detachment office, and chaplain - will be sitting in her driveway waiting to tell her the worst news she can imagine. In Luke's absence, Calli, alone with her daughter, learns that if anything is worth fighting for, it's the unpredictable new friendships that will sustain her through loneliness and the ever-present specter of widowhood. At the end Calli will find herself on an unexpected course full of epiphanies about herself and her marriage.\nThe Immortals is an emotional examination of marriage, friendship, war, and death. Tori Eversmann, through her distinctive voice that es from her own time as an Army wife, has given us an unforgettable story.","Kit Porter's fear that he is being followed is confirmed when he is arrested by Alec Weston, a captain in the City Guard.

This is the question that Gohar Homayounpour poses to herself, and to us, at the beginning of this memoir of displacement, nostalgia, love, and pain. Twenty years after leaving her country, Homayounpour, an Iranian, Western-trained psychoanalyst, returns to Tehran to establish a psychoanalytic practice. When an American colleague exclaims, \"I do not think that Iranians can free-associate!\" Homayounpour responds that in her opinion Iranians do nothing but. Iranian culture, she says, revolves around stories. Why wouldn't Freud's methods work, given Iranians' need to talk?\nThus begins a fascinating narrative of interlocking stories that resembles--more than a little--a psychoanalytic session. Homayounpour recounts the pleasure and pain of returning to her motherland, her passion for the work of Milan Kundera, her plex relationship with Kundera's Iranian translator (her father), and her own and other Iranians' anxieties of influence and disobedience. Woven throughout the narrative are glimpses of her sometimes frustrating, always candid, sessions with patients. Ms. N, a famous artist, dreams of abandonment and sits in the analyst's chair rather than on the analysand's couch; a young chador-clad woman expresses shame because she has lost her virginity; an eloquently suicidal young man cannot kill himself.\nAs a psychoanalyst, Homayounpour knows that behind every story told is another story that remains untold. Doing Psychoanalysis in Tehran connects the stories, spoken and unspoken, that ordinary Iranians tell about their lives before their hour is up.\nAbout the Author\nGohar Homayounpour is a practicing psychoanalyst in Tehran. She trains and supervises the psychoanalysts of the Freudian Group of Tehran and is Professor of Psychology at Shahid Besheti University Tehran.","When Francine Martin applies for the position of nanny with the popular Leclerc family, she is looking for much more than a new job.

The literary treatment of siblings opens up multiple perspectives on brothers' and sisters' emotions: love, hate, rivalry, desire, nurturing and ambivalence underlie sibling stories. These narratives are in turn inflected by rank, social context and most crucially, gender. This book examines these sibling relationships, focusing on the important vernacular literatures of Iceland, France, England and Germany, and building on recent research on siblings in psychology, history and social science. Multiple and subtle patterns in sibling interaction are teased out, such as the essential sibling task of \"borderwork\" (the establishment of individuality despite genetic resemblance), and the tensions caused by the easy substitutability of one sibling for another in certain social situations. When the sibling bond is extended to the in-law relation, plex emotional, strategic and political forces and powerful ambivalences nuance the relationship still further. Quasi-siblings: foster- or sworn-brothers plete the sibling picture in ways which reflect and contrast with the sibling blood-tie.

Fifteen hundred years ago, a holy man living in Rome was viciously turned inhuman by a blood thirsty vampire. Lucius' purity was ripped from him and he was left to struggle with his lamentable misfortune, although unknown to him or the evil powers that turned him, fate played a great hand in Lucius' new found reality.\nWe all have a purpose in this world and Lucius' was significant, yet he fought against his fate, against his hunger for human blood, and against the predator that now festered within him.\nThe fates stepped in again and offered him a skillful advocate. They sent him Sulla, a two thousand year old mystical vampire, who had foreseen Lucius' purpose in a vision and was determined to help him accept his fate as a gift, not a curse. With her help, Lucius recognized his task, and it wasn't to be a predator but a guardian. He was to change the ways in which vampire's treated humans. His intuitive mind and holy beliefs pushed him to create a new form of vampire that wouldn't promise passion for lust. He set out and succeeded in creating a powerful new coven of highly gifted vampires he named Elite. The Elite were conceived to follow his beliefs and fight for a new purpose, yet with great misfortune Lucius reached his final death before his vision was pleted. The Elite continued to follow his laws, but foolishly believed their purpose died with him, and acplished little in fulfilling his destiny.\nNow, fifteen hundred years later, his great granddaughter, Natalia, struggles to keep the balance between her vast gifts, her understanding of her inherited purpose, the return of a highly skilled warrior she's always desired, the consuming distraction of her sexual awakening, and a fascinating connection to a gifted human which can destroy everything.","://.fishpond.co.nz/Books/Canni...","This place and everyone in it are swallowed up.\nOn a night in the future of a tired, abandoned, wild city, on the night before the old days holiday of Halloween, the kids are out causing trouble.

Less so, maybe, than Buckman's amoral sister Alys, who takes special interest in Taverner & seems to have the world's only copies of his music albums...\nParanoid wrongness is expertly conveyed & resolved with a typically offbeat SF notion.

This richly-annotated translation by a leading British specialist makes these Carolingian histories accessible in English for the first time, encouraging readers to reassess and evaluate a crucially formative period of European history.\nProduced in the 830s in the imperial palace of Louis the Pious, The Annals of St-Bertin were continued away from the Court, first by Bishop Prudentius of Troyes, then by the great scholar-politician Archbishop Hinemar of Rheims. The authors' distinctive voices and interests give the work a personal tone rarely found in medieval annals. They also contain uniquely detailed information on Carolingian politics, especially the reign of the West Frankish king, Charles the Bald (840-877). No other source offers so much evidence on the Continental activities of the Vikings.\nJanet L. Nelson offers in this volume both an entree to a crucial Carolingian source and an introduction to the historical setting of teh Annals and possible ways of reading the evidence.\nThe Annals of St-Bertin will be valuable reading for academics, research students and undergraduates in medieval history, archaeology and medieval languages. It will also fascinate any general reader with an interest in the development of European culture and society.","A meandering story of an African motorcycling odyssea, interwoven with trekking expeditions in the mountains, murder in paradise and extraordinary sailing escapades.","The second volume in Siegfried Sassoon's beloved trilogy, The Complete Memoirs of George Sherston, with a new introduction by celebrated historian Paul Fussell\nA highly decorated English soldier and an acclaimed poet and novelist, Siegfried Sassoon won fame for his trilogy of fictionalized autobiographies that wonderfully capture the vanishing idylls of Edwardian England and the brutal realities of war.\nThe second volume of Siegfried Sassoon's semiautobiographical George Sherston trilogy picks up shortly after Memoirs of a Fox-hunting Man: in 1916, with the young Sherston deep in the trenches of WWI. For his decorated bravery, and also his harmful recklessness, he is soon sent to the Fourth Army School for officer training, then dispatched to Morlancourt, a raid, and on through the Somme. After being wounded by a bullet through the lung, he returns home to convalesce, where his questioning of the war and the British Military establishment leads him to write a public anti-war letter (verbatim the letter Sassoon wrote in 1917, entitled \"Finished with the War: A Soldier's Declaration\", which was eventually read in the British House of Commons). Through the help of close friend David Cromlech (based on Sassoon's friend Robert Graves) a medical board decides not to prosecute, but instead deem him to be mentally ill, suffering from shell-shock, and sends him to a hospital for treatment. Sassoon's stunning portrayal of a mind ing to terms with the brutal truths he has encountered in war--as well as his unsentimental, though often poetic, portrayal of class-defined life in England at wartime--is amongst the greatest books ever written about World War I, or war itself.\nFor more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Rose and I got some devastating news: a sweet friend and mother had an extremely aggressive form of breast cancer. Since I had just launched my first novel into the world, I decided to donate all my royalties for a period of months to the family to help them fight this horrible invader.

Cheri Chesley","On a sunny fall afternoon in 1988, Jon Sarkin was playing golf when, without a whisper of warning, his life changed forever. As he bent down to pick up his golf ball, something strange and massive happened inside his head; part of his brain seemed to unhinge, to split apart and float away. For an utterly inexplicable reason, a tiny blood vessel, thin as a thread, deep inside the folds of his gray matter had suddenly shifted ever so slightly, rubbing up against his acoustic nerve. Any noise now caused him excruciating pain.\nAfter months of seeking treatment to no avail, in desperation Sarkin resorted to radical deep-brain surgery, which seemed to go well until during recovery his brain began to bleed and he suffered a major stroke. When he awoke, he was a different man. Before the stroke, he was a calm, disciplined chiropractor, a happily married husband and father of a newborn son. Now he was transformed into a volatile and wildly exuberant obsessive, seized by a manic desire to create art, devoting virtually all his waking hours to furiously drawing, painting, and writing poems and letters to himself, strangely detached from his wife and child, and unable to return to his normal working life. His sense of self had been shattered, his intellect intact but his way of being drastically altered. His art became a relentless quest for the right words and pictures to unlock the secrets of how to live this strange new life. And what was even stranger was that he remembered his former self.\nIn a beautifully crafted narrative, award-winning journalist and Pulitzer Prize finalist Amy Ellis Nutt interweaves Sarkin's remarkable story with a fascinating tour of the history of and latest findings in neuroscience and evolution that illuminate how the brain produces, from its web of billions of neurons and chaos of liquid electrical pulses, the richness of human experience that makes us who we are. Nutt brings vividly to life pivotal moments of discovery in neuroscience, from the shocking \"rebirth\" of a young girl hanged in 1650 to the first autopsy of an autistic savant's brain, and the extraordinary true stories of people whose personalities and cognitive abilities were dramatically altered by brain trauma, often in shocking ways.\nProbing recent revelations about the workings of creativity in the brain and the role of art in the evolution of human intelligence, she reveals how Jon Sarkin's obsessive need to create mirrors the earliest function of art in the brain. Introducing major findings about how our sense of self transcends the bounds of our own bodies, she explores how it is that the brain generates an individual \"self\" and how, if damage to our brains can so alter who we are, we can nonetheless be said to have a soul.\nFor Jon Sarkin, with his personality and sense of self permanently altered, making art became his bridge back to life, a means of reassembling from the shards of his former self a new man who could rejoin his family and fashion a viable life. He is now an acclaimed artist who exhibits at some of the country's most prestigious venues, as well as a devoted husband to his wife, Kim, and father to their three children. At once wrenching and inspiring, this is a story of the remarkable human capacity to overe the most daunting obstacles and of the extraordinary workings of the human mind.","In this final book of The Gisborne Saga, Gisborne, spymaster and valued knight of Richard Lionheart, is forced into a fierce duel in which his wife and son are thrust round the board in a brutal game of revenge.\nIs it the Knights Templar who seek to avenge their own?

After moving to London from Karachi at age two, Imran's response to his strange new surroundings is to engage in an eternal quest to bee the quintessential English gentleman: tie perfectly knotted, shirt pristinely ironed, hair neatly bed. Like most boys, he also has a parallel obsession with cars and girls: he yearns to go driving off into the distance in a Jaguar XJS and encountering danger, adventure, and a vivacious brunette. This is a lighthearted and amusing look at the results of East meeting West inside the head of a precocious and headstrong boy.\nAt age one, Pakistan-born Imran Ahmad moved to London and grew up torn between his Islamic identity and his desire to embrace the West. In this endearing memoir, Imran recalls his childhood in a series of vivid snapshots: outrage as deserved victory is snatched away from him in the Karachi Bonnie Baby contest by third world corruption and injustice; bitterness as he is tricked out of his collection of Tarzan bubble-gum cards by junior con artists; the heady taste of success in the Metropolitan Police schools quiz; joy at passing the entrance exam to the local grammar school; uncertainty as he seeks to bee a doctor; bewilderment as he tries to learn about women at university; and shock at experiencing racism in its many forms.

Will he really be \"left behind\" if he doesn't embrace Jesus Christ as his personal saviour? Will he be sent to Hell for having coffee with girls (especially non-Muslim ones)? Is there a correlation between studying and passing exams, or is it entirely the will of God? Is it okay to be Western and Muslim, or are the two irreconcilable? And what about America, that alluring land of many contradictions? Eventually Imran embarks on a determined quest to bee the quintessential English gentleman: tie perfectly knotted, shirt pristinely ironed, hair neatly bed.

And during those four decades, his wide knowledge, keen judgment, prodigious energy, and sharp sense of humor have made him America's most celebrated film critic. He was the first such critic to win a Pulitzer Prize--one of just three film critics ever to receive that honor--and the only one to have a star dedicated to him on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. His groundbreaking hit TV show, At the Movies, meanwhile, has made \"two thumbs up\" one of the most coveted hallmarks in the entire industry.\nNo critic alive has reviewed more movies than Roger Ebert, and yet his essential writings have never been collected in a single volume--until now. With Awake in the Dark, both fans and film buffs can finally bask in the best of Ebert's work. The reviews, interviews, and essays collected here present a picture of this indispensable critic's numerous contributions to the cinema and cinephilia. From The Godfatherto GoodFellas, from Cries and Whispersto Crash, the reviews in Awake in the Darkspan some of the most exceptional periods in film history, from the dramatic rise of rebel Hollywood and the heyday of the auteur, to the triumph of blockbuster films such as Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark, to the indie revolution that is still with us today.\nThe extraordinary interviews gathered in Awake in the Darkcapture Ebert engaging not only some of the most influential directors of our time--Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Woody Allen, Robert Altman, Werner Herzog, and Ingmar Bergman--but also some of the silver screen's most respected and dynamic personalities, including actors as diverse as Robert Mitchum, James Stewart, Warren Beatty, and Meryl Streep. Ebert's remarkable essays play a significant part in Awake in the Darkas well. The book contains some of Ebert's most admired pieces, among them a moving appreciation of John Cassavetes and a loving tribute to the virtues of black-and-white films.\nIf Pauline Kael and Andrew Sarris were godmother and godfather to the movie generation, then Ebert is its voice from within--a writer whose exceptional intelligence and daily bursts of insight and enthusiasm have shaped the way we think about the movies. Awake in the Dark, therefore, will be a treasure trove not just for fans of this seminal critic, but for anyone desiring a fascinating and pulsively readable chronicle of film since the late 1960s.","Three days before he's due to tie the knot with Priscilla Livengood, eligible bachelor Cornelious Weaver suffers a massive heart attack-in another woman's bed.

An approach built on the principles of free trade and, since the 1980s, open capital markets, is beginning to fracture. With disappointing growth rates across the Western world, nations are no longer willing to sacrifice national interests for global growth; nor are their leaders able--or willing--to sell the idea of pursuing a global agenda of prosperity to their citizens.\nCombining historical analysis with current affairs, economist Stephen D. King provides a provocative and engaging account of why globalization is being rejected, what a world ruled by rival states with conflicting aims might look like, and how the pursuit of nationalist agendas could result in a race to the bottom. King argues that a rejection of globalization and a return to \"autarky\" will risk economic and political conflict, and he uses lessons from history to gauge how best to avoid the worst possible outes.","The Fire of Love is a tense psychological thriller and the second book in the Dr Power and Superintendent Lynch series.

The truth is: politics and innuendo clouded that story from the very beginning, with the result that few people really understand who The Duke and Duchess of Windsor were and what forces propelled them to their infamous fate.\nThe Royal W.E. examines the individual and intertwined lives of Wallis and Edward - or \"W.E.\" as they referred to themselves - and provides readers with unique glimpses of the real people, as opposed to the sensationalized characters, that were The Duke and Duchess of Windsor.\nThrough careful study of more than 75 years of rhetoric and scholarship, Victoria Martinez takes on the most controversial charges lodged against the couple (Was Wallis a hermaphrodite? Were the Duke and Duchess Nazi sympathizers?) with candor and evenhandedness. In analyzing the early lives of Wallis and the ex-king and their later relationships with other members of the Royal Family, her approach is to deal with all parties as human beings, whose true faults - though significant - were far less sinister than history has led us to believe. Ms. Martinez also addresses the ever-popular subject of the Duchess's jewels, including new research on the famous 1946 Ednam Lodge jewel heist to dispel the long-held rumors that the Duke and Duchess mitted jewel theft and insurance fraud.\nThe subjects in  are not always mainstream, well-known, or even consistent with \"popular\" opinion, and the objective is not to make anyone \"like\" the couple. Instead, readers will find refreshingly honest and accurate portrayals of W.E. that will help them understand the real people behind the myth and hype.\n\"Prejudice and preconception are difficult things to set aside, particularly after so many years of negative stories and sordid rumor, but I think readers here will discover an alternative and convincing look at the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. I am sure they would approve and perhaps, just perhaps, the future may be a little bit kinder to Edward and Wallis because of the efforts of people like Ms. Martinez.\" -Greg King, author of The Duchess of Windsor: The Unmon Life of Wallis Simpson","First Love Or First Bite?

With this distinctive proposition in mind, Curry introduces and discusses all the major concepts needed to understand the full range of ecological ethics. He discusses light green or anthropocentric ethics with the examples of stewardship, lifeboat ethics, and social ecology; the mid-green or intermediate ethics of animal liberation/rights; and dark or deep green ecocentric ethics. Particular attention is given to the Land Ethic, the Gaia Hypothesis and Deep Ecology and its offshoots: Deep Green Theory, Left Biocentrism and the Earth Manifesto. Ecofeminism is also considered and attention is paid to the close relationship between ecocentrism and virtue ethics. Other chapters discuss green ethics as post-secular, moral pluralism and pragmatism, green citizenship, and human population in the light of ecological ethics. In this new edition, all these have been updated and joined by discussions of climate change, sustainable economies, education, and food from an ecocentric perspective.\nThis prehensive and wide-ranging textbook offers a radical but critical introduction to the subject which puts ecocentrism and the critique of anthropocentrism back at the top of the ethical, intellectual and political agenda. It will be of great interest to students and activists, and to a wider public.","She was standing on stolen ground...\nThe year is 1934.

Levine wondered, What if the little guy could see all trades in real time and, in the process, cut out the middlemen who picked his pocket with every trade? But for that to happen, the market had to be plugged in.\nAnd so Levine created a puterized trading hub named Island where small traders swapped stocks. Soon after its launch, Island spawned a day-trading revolution that would reshape the market. Eventually, Levine's creation became the electronic version of the New York Stock Exchange, and in a few short years the world's capital flowed through a vast jungle of fiber-optic cables.\nBy then, the market that Levine had sought to fix had turned upside down. The giant institutions and the little guys had developed a shared interest, and they were both imperiled. The solution: \"dark pools\" - secretive exchanges where the \"whales,\" big institutional investors that often traded the little guys' money, could move through the turbulent electronic waters unmolested. But soon the bots acquired night vision; they learned how to peer into the darkness. Growing savvier with each tick of the tape -- always learning - they steadily fed on the whales, evolving into a new breed of high-speed middlemen.\nDark Pools is the fascinating story of how global markets have been hijacked by trading robots - many so self-directed that humans can't predict what they'll do next. And it shows how the new players moving into artificial intelligence are on the verge of tipping the entire system toward a global meltdown that could happen in minutes - maybe even seconds.","At 24, Nia James' is living a life that most women would be content with.

Wellum and Brent E. Parker have assembled a team of scholars who offer a fresh perspective regarding the interrelationship between the biblical covenants. Each chapter seeks to demonstrate how the covenants serve as the backbone to the grand narrative of Scripture. For example, New Testament scholar Thomas Schreiner writes on the Sabbath mand from the Old Testament and thinks through its applications to new covenant believers. Christopher Cowan wrestles with the warning passages of Scripture, texts which are often viewed by covenant theologians as evidence for a \"mixed\" view of the church. Jason DeRouchie provides a biblical theology of \"seed\" and demonstrates that the covenantal view is incorrect in some of its conclusions. Jason Meyer thinks through the role of law in both the old and new covenants. John Meade unpacks circumcision in the OT and how it is applied in the NT, providing further warrant to reject covenant theology's link of circumcision with (infant) baptism. Oren Martin tackles the issue of Israel and land over against a dispensational reading, and Richard Lucas offers an exegetical analysis of Romans 9-11, arguing that it does not require a dispensational understanding. From issues of ecclesiology to the warning passages in Hebrews,  carefully navigates a mediating path between the dominant theological systems of covenant theology and dispensationalism to offer the reader a better way to understand God's one plan of redemption.","BRADY CLARK'S FAMILY chooses horrible timing for their first camping trip--a night when a fierce storm leaves them stranded in the woods.\nCircumstances that leave him running around in the forest wearing, well, let's just say less than appropriate attire cause him to unleash his anger by physically assaulting his father.\nNot yet ready to face the discipline he has ing, Brady makes false allegations against both of his parents.

The seventeen-syllable form is rooted in a Japanese tradition of close observation of nature, of making poetry from subtle suggestion. Infused by its great practitioners with the spirit of Zen Buddhism, the haiku has served as an example of the power of direct observation to the first generation of American modernist poets like Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams and also as an example of spontaneity and Zen alertness to the new poets of the 1950's.\nThis definite collection brings together in fresh translations by an American poet the essential poems of the three greatest masters: Matsuo Basho in the seventeenth century; Yosa Buson in the eighteenth century; and Kobayashi Issa in the early nineteenth century. Robert Haas has written a lively and informed introduction, provided brief examples by each poet of their work in the halibun, or poetic prose form, and included informal notes to the poems. This is a useful and inspiring addition to The Essential Poets series.","A Prisoner of His Past\nGabriel Ridgley, the Marquess of Tremont, is dubbed The Angel for his pristine reputation.

No work based on recent research has, so far, appeared to fill the gap between these two classes. The present volume is an attempt to supply this desideratum. The ever-growing number of intelligent readers who have neither the time nor the inclination to peruse the large histories, and whose minds are too matured to be satisfied with mere schoolbooks, has been kept steadily in view by the author. He has striven to record every fact of importance, and yet not to overload his narrative with too many distracting details.\nAs the title indicates, it is the History of the People that he has endeavoured to portray. Special attention accordingly has been devoted to their struggles to secure those free institutions through which in the end they were able to express their will. The social conditions that prevailed at different times, by which the life of the people is chiefly illustrated, are dealt with in successive chapters with fullness and in detail.","If you're going to colonise a planet, you'd better be willing to fight for it.\nWithin Anphobos, there grows a new race.

Manipulated by the underground lobby since the ing of Christ, and revealed today by The Phoenician Code, those hidden facts e to light to reassess some major realities. Much more than just an anti-thesis to: \"The DaVinci Code\".\nWhat is true and what is false in the Old Testament? What is the relation between Cyrus II and the Babylonian Brotherhood, the founding brothers of the Hebrew people!? Why Cyrus II was called the Messiah in the Old Testament!? Who were Rashi's Templars and what were they searching for in Jerusalem? Who was the \"Head\" they venerated? Who were the Scottish and York Rite Freemasons in some additional degrees and why they considered the Tower of Babel as important as the Temple of Solomon?\nWhat is true and what is false in the New Testament? Why have we been manipulated to believe that a Galilean is a Jew, although Galilee has been considered as Gelil Haggoyim, which is translated into \"Circle of the Gentiles,\" or \"Galilee of the Nations,\" which is \"Galilee of the non-Jews.\" Was Jesus a Galilean-Phoenician? What did the Galileans believe in? Why Jesus was named \"Immanuel,\" which means \"El with us.\" Why there were two Bethlehems?\n\"The Phoenician Code\" answers all these questions and more....\n----------------------\nAcclaims for the book:\n----------------------\n\"Karim El Koussa is an Award Winning Lebanese Author, but his world wide reputation (and recognition) is rising rapidly. His novel, 'The Phoenician Code' is written in a great way mixing intelligence and imagination altogether and is indeed equal to works written by big big novelists. It's a book that makes everyone think hard about possible results or truth that we may take into consideration--concerning the non-authentic records of the Biblical Israel on both Historical and Archaeological levels, and that Jesus Christ could well be Phoenician and not Jew, along with proving that his relationship with Mary Magdalene was not at all sexual, but rather, a strong spiritual relation between a Master and his Disciple. It's indeed a bold text with plenty of actions going on. A thriller that could well be turned into a Movie.\" - Tv anchor and published poet-writer Karen Boustany declared in an interview with the author on one of the leading Tv stations in Lebanon, in a book segment called 'Kitab' on MTV Al-Loubnaniya, August 11, 2012.\nIt has been suggested for \"Additional Readings\" about the Phoenicians for students to refer to at school in Author Terri Raymond's book <>published by HomeSchool Brew, July 2014.\nShow Less","SUFFERING FOR HIS ART\nChiaki is gearing up for his first season as a conductor.

For years, used copies have been making the rounds, manding a premium auction price & making a profit for used book dealers. Now, you can not only get your own fresh, updated version, you can get it as an ebook. Given its theme, the metamorphosis seems particularly ironic.\nFor two years, Pete Garey wandered through the strange new world of Earth after the Change, a moment when technology ceased to work & things like planes, trains & automobiles became junk. He was alone until the day he was found by a unicorn who'd bee his familiar. Ariel is just one of the many magical creatures to appear after the Change, but the only one with the stunning ability (or, perhaps, desire) to talk. The bond between Pete & Ariel will be like no other he's experienced.\nIf you know mythology, you know what anyone who wishes to be close to a unicorn must be. Pete's a virgin of 20. In many ways he's more unworldly than expected. Whether the loss of the technical wonders of modernity has contributed to his naivete, or if it is the result of so many years in a depopulated country, is difficult to say. Could be he would have grown up that way even in the before-Change world. Whatever the reason, it makes him perfectly suited to be Ariel's friend & foil.\nAriel is pure--she's a unicorn, after all--but no pushover. Like Pete, she has steel to balance her softness. At times, the struggle between the good & bad inside each of them is as great a threat as the unmitigated evil they join to defeat. Isn't that the conflict at the heart of all good literature? In Ariel, readers have many dark/light things to consider, including deciding for themselves whether the world is a better or worse place after the Change. The answer is as ambiguous as most real life decisions. Boyett isn't going to do your thinking for you.\nMaybe that's the lasting appeal of Ariel. Little is clear cut in this fantasy. Not the motives of the characters. Not the true nature of the mythical beasts that emerge. Not even the why of everything that happened. Such unanswered questions are among the many reasons your thoughts will turn again & again to , re-examining these unknowns.--Lisa DuMond (edited)","An Inconvenient Truth--Gore's groundbreaking, battle cry of a follow-up to the bestselling Earth in the Balance--is being published to tie in with a documentary film of the same name.

As they address the right or wrong of such action, it is also a time when, in the language of the just war tradition, the wise would deeply investigate their true claim to jus ad bellum (\"the right of war\"). Wars have negative consequences, not the least impinging on human life, and offer infrequent and uncertain benefits, yet war is part of the human condition.\nJames G. Murphy's insightful analysis of the jus ad bellum criteria--petent authority, just cause, right intention, probability of success, last resort, and proportionality--is grounded in a variety of contemporary examples from World War I through Vietnam, the \"soccer war\" between Honduras and El Salvador, and Afghanistan, and the Middle East conflict. Murphy argues persuasively that understanding jus ad bellum requires a primary focus on the international mon good and the good of peace. Only secondarily should the argument about going to war hinge on the right of self-defense; in fact, pursuing the mon good requires political action, given that peace is not simply the absence of violence. He moves on to demonstrate the interconnectedness of the jus ad bellum criteria, contending that some criteria depend logically on others--and that petent authority, not just cause, is ultimately the most significant criterion in an analysis of going to war. This timely study will be of special interest to scholars and students in ethics, war and peace, and international affairs.","\"BATWOMAN BEGINS\" parts one and two!

Many pastors and leaders are finding the nature of ministry to be unsustainable in today's culture, and they are searching for help. They realize their initial enthusiasm and ministry training are simply not enough to reach the finish line. Business as usual is not working - deep down inside something is missing. This sacred thirst is the beginning of a deeper intimacy with God. Leaders are discovering spiritual direction as a proven pathway to recover spiritual life and the sustainable ministry that follows.\nSeveral years ago spiritual direction was almost unheard of in the Protestant world. Today, this ministry is referred to in articles and books as well as highlighted at conferences. More and more leaders are intrigued and ready to investigate the value and practice of spiritual direction. This book seeks to give the reader a starting point from which to explore the ministry of spiritual direction. It offers an inside look at the history, theological foundation, and the praxis of this spiritual discipline creating a desire for further exploration and participation.\nForming the Leader's Soul: An Invitation to Spiritual Direction begins by highlighting the increg at-risk nature of ministry leadership with a focus on the systemic issues in Christian organizations that undermine spiritual and emotional health.\nWith this as the felt need, the book goes on to emphasize the value of spiritual direction, undergirding this practice biblically and historically. This is necessary since spiritual direction is still in the early stages of rediscovery in the Protestant tradition.\nHaving established the need and value of spiritual direction, Dr. Dirks helps the reader understand how this ministry is carried out. Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556), who authored Spiritual Exercises (a leader's manual for conducting spiritual direction), stands at the forefront as someone to guide us. Dirks draws key insights from his philosophy of direction seeking to apply them in today's context.\nThe author then turns to the wide range of contributions made in the contemporary field of spiritual direction, exploring the guiding principles and practices that flesh it out. The goal is to make spiritual direction appealing and accessible to today's Christian leader.\nThe book seeks to strengthen the reader's appreciation of spiritual direction by drawing upon the author's own experience as a pastor for over three decades. He uses his personal journey into spiritual direction (both as a directee and director) as a window and an invitation to discover more. Each chapter ends with a short, real-life story from a leader who participates in spiritual direction.","This is an alternate Cover Edition for \u0001.\nAuthor of cult classics The Pumpkin Plan and The Toilet Paper Entrepreneur offers a simple, counterintuitive cash management solution that will help small businesses break out of the doom spiral and achieve instant profitability.\nConventional accounting uses the logical (albeit, flawed) formula: Sales - Expenses = Profit.

Following 4 simple principles can simplify accounting and make it easier to manage a profitable business by looking at bank account balances.\n.

Businesses that attain early and sustained profitability have a better shot at achieiving long-term growth.\nWith dozens of case studies, practical, step-by-step advice, and his signature sense of humor, Michalowicz has the game-changing roadmap for any entrepreneur to make money they always dreamed of.\"","Brooklyn knows that there's no good without evil, no right without wrong.

He was an icon of rugged individualism who had been to hell and back, telling the tale as never before. In his unforgettable autobiography, Johnny Cash tells the truth about the highs and lows, the struggles and hard-won triumphs, and the people who shaped him.\nIn his own words, Cash set the record straight -- and dispelled a few myths -- as he looked unsparingly at his remarkable life: from the joys of his boyhood in Dyess, Arkansas to superstardom in Nashville, Tennessee, the road of Cash's life has been anything but smooth.

He finally discovers how much his step-mother had helped him, when his mother has died recently, when he and his brother were too young. He also feels his helplessness for not being to support her, in her efforts to maintain her mentally-invalid son, at a late age. Also is described the rule of monarchy in Nepal, when it held the absolute power, and the royal massacre, which eliminated the entire family of the king. During the Maoist-war, the violence unleashed by them and counter-violence by the security forces too is dealt in fair-details. This book is an effort to define the socio-politics of the Indian subcontinent, through fiction, which has been remarkably violent--as far as one could remember.\nEpic and dramatic\nNepal is an enigma to outsiders but a new novel opens a stunning window into the country and its society. The Royal Enigma uniquely mixes fiction and fact to tell the epic story of the 2001 assassination of the Nepalese royal family and its ongoing impact on the people of Nepal. Chapters detailing actual events alternate with the fictional life of Nawin, his life a personal mirror on the larger tragic national events. The Royal Enigma tells a real life story in a very different and appealing way. For years, Nepal was savaged by a civil war. On one side were the King and the democratically elected government (not quite the same thing), on the other side were brutal Maoist revolutionaries who terrorized the countryside. After years of war, one night most of the Nepalese royal family was assassinated. The official story? The Crown Prince shot all of them and then himself because he could not marry the woman he loved. The story most Nepalese believe? The King was assassinated because he was secretly working with the Maoists to destroy the democratically elected government. The Royal Enigma presents all the known facts and theories behind the assassinations. It is a great novel for anyone interested in real life political conspiracies! The story of the civil war is paralleled by chapters focusing on the disruption and corruption it brought to Nepalese society. That story is personified in Nawin and his family and friends. He leaves his family responsibilities of looking after his step-mother and disabled half-brother, and instead bees a pharmaceutical salesperson working from Kathmandu. Nawin and the colourful people he meets illustrate traditional Nepalese culture along with the intrusion of outside elements. The two stories are epic and dramatic, spanning decades.\nVictor Schwartzman","Is your Christian life weighing you down?

In Lincoln, Inc., Jackie Hogan examines the uses (and abuses) of the sixteenth president in the United States today.The book takes readers on a journey through the little white lies of Lincoln tourism, and offers a front-row seat as the martyr president is invoked in heated political debates over such issues as homosexuality, abortion, and the war on terror. Readers enter classrooms that use an idealized Honest Abe to Lincolnize American schoolchildren. And readers step into the alternate universe of Lincoln fiction that transforms the Rail Splitter, by turns, into a hapless time-traveler, a sentimental cyborg, an axe-wielding zombie slayer, or a frontier heart-throb. But Lincoln, Inc. is more than a tour through the thriving Lincoln industry today.Whether in staid biographies, blockbuster films, school pageants, or sleeping pill advertisements, Hogan shows how the use of the Lincoln image reveals the nation s shared fears and fascinations. The book analyzes the ways we employ Lincoln today in our political, ideological, personal, and national struggles; the ways we simultaneously deify and mercially exploit him; the ways he is packaged and sold in the marketplace of American ideas. In learning about Lincoln, Inc., we learn about ourselves, about who we think we are, and who we wish we could be.\"","My life was perfect.

Characterized by a very dense visual style, featuring flowery backgrounds and big-eyed, androgynous boys and girls, it is an extremely popular and prominent genre in Japan. Why is this genre so appealing? Where did it e from? Why do so many of the stories feature androgynous characters and homosexual romance?\nPassionate Friendshipanswers these questions by reviewing Japanese girls' print culture from its origins in 1920s and 1930s girls' literary magazines to the 1970s \"revolution\" shojo manga, when young women artists took over the genre. It looks at the narrative and aesthetic features of girls' literature and illustration across the twentieth century, both pre- and postwar, and discusses how these texts addressed and formed a reading munity of girls, even as they were informed by peting political and social ideologies.\nThe author traces the development of girls' culture in pre-World War II magazines and links it to postwar teenage girls' ics and popular culture. Within this culture, as private and cloistered as the schools most readers attended, a discourse of girlhood arose that avoided heterosexual romance in favor of \"S relationships,\" passionate friendships between girls. This preference for homogeneity is echoed in the postwar genre of boys' love manga written for girls. Both prewar S relationships and postwar boys' love stories gave girls a protected space to develop and explore their identities and sexuality apart from the pressures of a patriarchal society. Shojo manga offered to a reading munity of girls a place to share the difficulties of adolescence as well as an alternative to the image of girls purveyed by the media to boys and men.","My rules were created so I'd have control and be able to remove any and all elements of emotion when it es to men -- when it es to relationships, period.

Although at first glance and to its many devotees Inari worship may seem to be a unified phenomenon, it is in fact exceedingly multiple, noncodified, and noncentralized. No single regulating institution, dogma, scripture, or myth centers the practice. In this exceptionally insightful study, the author explores the worship of Inari in the context of homogeneity and diversity in Japan. The shape-shifting fox and the wish-fulfilling jewel, the main symbols of Inari, serve as interpretive metaphors to describe the simultaneously shared yet infinitely diverse meanings that cluster around the deity. That such diversity exists without the apparent knowledge of Inari worshippers is explained by the use of several municative strategies that minimize the exchange of substantive information. Shared generalized meanings (tatemae) are articulated while private meanings and plexities (honne) are left unspoken. The appearance of unity is reinforced by a set of symbols representing fertility, change, and growth in ways that can be interpreted and understood by many individuals of various ages and occupations.\nThe Fox and the Jewel describes the rich plexity of Inari worship in contemporary Japan. It explores questions of institutional and popular power in religion, demonstrates the ways people make religious figures personally meaningful, and documents the kinds of municative styles that preserve the appearance of homogeneity in the face of astonishing factionalism.","This is basically poetry of a rather abstract sort, broken up into five sections: The Garden, The Brothers, The Flood, The Tower & The Land. The author introduces each section with a scriptural passage from Genesis, then rewrites the tale thus told in an entirely modern, disconcerting way. He apparently does have a good bit of biblical knowledge, but he treats the material more as myth than as divine revelation. Even if the events never happened, they necessarily \"are\" now & forever. Napier runs with this idea, making his lyrical retelling a present-tense yet timeless story. His speakers refer to places & events throughout history, sometimes playing off of modern phrases & references. The author describes  as an \"existentialist interpretation\" of the major events of Genesis' opening chapter. It's rather striking, however, as Adam & Cain basically claim the world as their own domain, criticize God for punishing them for things he supposedly led them into, & do all but tell God to go jump in the lake. Each speaker basically concludes his personal quintet with the plea \"e sweet death,\" essentially refuting God entirely. The opening section is particularly disconcerting, as Adam criticizes & lambasts God from the time of his creation to the moment of his expulsion from the Garden (which came about because of \"a silly tree\").--Daniel Jolley (edited)","Now a stirring movie from Paramount Pictures--starring Kate Mara (House of Cardsand Fantastic Four) and David Oyelowo (Selma)--this inspirational, news-making life story of the young female hostage who in 2005 single-handedly talked the infamous Atlanta courthouse killer, Brian Nichols, into surrendering peacefully by gaining his confidence through her prayers and personal faith and by reading passages to him from the Christian blockbuster A Purpose Driven Life.\nIn March 2005, Ashley Smith made headlines around the globe when she miraculously talked her way out of the hands of alleged courthouse killer Brian Nichols after he took her hostage for seven hours in her suburban Atlanta apartment.

And at the heart of his palace is the Sultan's vast Harem, the domain of hundreds of scented, pampered women--some wives, some concubines, some merely slaves.

Spenser will need Hawk's help to find peace for Mattie - a job that's more dangerous than he ever thought.","Fifteen-year-old Aki Simon has a theory. And it's mostly about sex.\nNo, it isn't that kind of theory. Aki already knows she's bisexual--even if, until now, it's mostly been in the hypothetical sense. Aki has dated only guys so far, and her best friend, Lori, is the only person who knows she likes girls, too.\nActually, Aki's theory is that she's got only one shot at living an interesting life--and that means she's got to stop sitting around and thinking so much. It's time for her to actually do something. Or at least try.\nSo when Aki and Lori set off on a church youth-group trip to a small Mexican town for the summer and Aki meets Christa--slightly older, far more experienced--it seems her theory is prime for the testing.\nBut it's not going to be easy. For one thing, how exactly do two girls have sex, anyway? And more important, how can you tell if you're in love? It's going to be a summer of testing theories--and the result may just be love.","Lutie McFee's history has taught her to avoid attachments...to people, to places, and to almost everything.

While Lutie shoplifts for kicks, Fate spends most of his time reading, watching weird TV shows and worrying about global warming and the endangerment of pandas.\nAs if their life is not dismal enough, one day, while shopping in their local Wal-Mart, Floy keels over and the two motherless kids are suddenly faced with the choice of being wards of the state or hightailing it out of town in Floy's old Pontiac. Choosing the latter, they head off to Las Vegas in search of a father who has no known address, no phone number and, clearly, no interest in the kids he left behind.","When Elizabeth Bennet refuses his hand, Darcy is devastated and makes it his mission to change.

As gang fought gang, the streets echoed with the sound of violence and ran with blood. Razor chronicles in pelling detail the nether world ruled by fabled vice queens Tilly Devine and Kate Leigh, and financed by the spoils of illegal drugs and alcohol, prostitution, gambling and extortion. Gangsters such as Guido Calletti, Big Jim Devine and Frank 'the Little Gunman' Green killed, robbed and slashed with impunity.

Each of those religions and denominations has its own belief system--its followers act on faith--even though, as author Jack Gage points out, \"all the adherents of these different belief systems inhabit the same world, with the same physical facts, with access to the same knowledge.\" So how and why did so many religions e into existence? And how do the various religious explanations--whether Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Muslim, or any other--for how the world and the people in it began stack up against scientific fact?","\"Altar of Secrets: Sex, Politics, and Money in the Philippine Catholic Church is the first of its kind in the country. Journalist Aries C. Rufo shows a Church that is cloaked in secrecy. It keeps the wrongdoing of its bishops and priests - in sexual misconduct and financial mismanagement - within its confines and lets them get away, unpunished. Accountability, after all, is not a strong suit of the Church. Rufo also delves into how the Church influences policy, as nowhere among Catholic countries in the world is the Church deeply involved in the shaping of policy than in the Philippines. Overall, reforms are taking place, but these are highly dependent on the Church leaders, the bishops who try to change mindsets and systems.\"","A powerful, painful, funny play that sifts the evidence from every side and puts Justice herself in the dock.","Get in.

From a fortress-like former bank building, American Pain's doctors distributed massive quantities of oxycodone to hundreds of customers a day, mostly traffickers and addicts who came by the vanload. Inked muscle-heads ran the clinic's security. Former strippers operated the pharmacy, counting out pills and stashing cash in garbage bags. Under their lab coats, the doctors carried guns and it was all legal sort of. American Pain was the brainchild of Chris George, a 27-year-old convicted drug felon. The son of a South Florida home builder, Chris George grew up in ultra-rich Wellington, where Bill Gates, Springsteen, and Madonna kept houses. Thick-necked from weightlifting, he and his twin brother hung out with mobsters, invested in strip clubs, brawled with cops, and grinned for their mug shots. After the housing market stalled, a local doctor clued in the brothers to the burgeoning underground market for lightly regulated prescription painkillers. In Florida, pain clinics could dispense the meds, and no one tracked the patients. Seizing the opportunity, Chris George teamed up with the doctor, and word got out. Just two years later Chris had raked in $40 million, and 90 percent of the pills his doctors prescribed flowed north to feed the rest of the country's insatiable narcotics addiction. Meanwhile, hundreds more pain clinics in the mold of American Pain had popped up in the Sunshine State, creating a gigantic new drug industry. American Pain chronicles the rise and fall of this game-changing pill mill, and how it helped tip the nation into its current opioid crisis, the deadliest drug epidemic in American history. The narrative swings back and forth between Florida and Kentucky, and is populated by a gaudy and diverse cast of characters. This includes the incongruous band of wealthy bad boys, thugs and esteemed physicians who built American Pain, as well as penniless Kentucky clans who transformed themselves into painkiller trafficking rings. It includes addicts whose lives were devastated by American Pain's drugs, and the federal agents and grieving mothers who labored for years to bring the clinic's crew to justice.\"","Learn from a legend!

Crafty Cigarette is the powerful story of a teenager ing of age in the 70s, as seen through his eyes, who, on the cusp of adulthood discovers a band that is new to him, The Jam, which leads him into being a Mod. Growing up in Suburbia where he finds life rather dull and hard to make friends Crafty Cigarette goes beyond just being a tale of a young Mod's passage into adulthood; it also focuses on the pitfalls of success or, rather, the lack of it, highlighting the failure of his father's circus career, who once worked with the famous Italian clown Charlie Cairoli, only to be sacked by Cairoli whilst he was on the verge of making it, thereby making him the Pete Best of the Clown world. The ramifications of this blow to his proud father's ego just adds to the confused and crazy skewed outlook of our young hero. Crafty Cigarette is a distillation of the metamorphosis of youth, embodied with a rebirth of the key character upon hearing the opening chord of The Jam's song 'All Mod Cons' and then growing up at a frantic pace, in keeping with Weller's shouted '1,2,3 4' intro . Written in the first person, the story rocks along at a fast clip, on a par with a supercharged Jam single... a pelling narrative with the key character struggling to find his identity against the backdrop of late 70s chaos. Without being nostalgic or sentimental, A Crafty Cigarette is a candid snapshot of English suburban life in the late 70s and early 80s, the book is raw, honest, dark and witty, with the values and culture of Mod being paramount throughout, though not always presented as the 'be all and end all'. A Crafty Cigarette is a powerful story and arguably, not since The Who's 'Quadrophenia', has there been such an in-depth study into the confused and multi-faceted lifestyle of striving to be a Mod... but this time, set in the very thick of the '79 Mod revival.","Contains\"The Girl-Thing Who Went Out for Sushi\" by Pat Cadigan, which won the Hugo Award for Best Novelette (2013) and the Locus Award for SF Best Novelette (2013).\n\"One giant leap for mankind\".

Using the Bard's own immortal list of a man's seven ages in As You Like It, Bate deduces the crucial events of Shakespeare's life and connects them to his world and work as never before.\nHere is the author as an infant, born into a world of plague and syphillis, diseases with which he became closely familiar; as a schoolboy, a position he portrayed in The Merry Wives of Windsor, in which a clever, cheeky lad named William learns Latin grammar; as a lover, married at eighteen to an older woman already pregnant, perhaps presaging Bassanio, who in The Merchant of Venice won a wife who could save him from financial ruin. Here, too, is Shakespeare as a soldier, writing Henry the Fifth's St. Crispin's Day speech, with a nod to his own monarch Elizabeth I's passionate addresses; as a justice, revealing his possible legal training in his precise use of the law in plays from Hamletto Macbeth; and as a pantaloon, an early retiree because of, Bate postulates, either illness or a scandal. Finally, Shakespeare enters oblivion, with sonnets that suggest he actively sought immortality through his art and secretly helped shape his posthumous image more than anyone ever knew.\nEqual parts masterly detective story, brilliant literary analysis, and insightful world history, Soul of the Ageis more than a superb new recounting of Shakespeare's experiences; it is a bold and entertaining work of scholarship and speculation, one that shifts from past to present, reality to the imagination, to reveal how this unsurpassed artist came to be.","Going vegan can be a daunting prospect.

It is a resonant, understated love story of beauty, deprivation, and tragedy.","The Mobdidn't take \"no\" for an answer, so when \"Bugsy\" Siegel and Moe Sedway grabbed a hold of a few co bosses and told 'em they were now partners in their Las Vegas cos, the old bosses glumly agreed. Within five years Las Vegas was the Mob's greatest venture and most spectacular success, and through 40 years of frenzy, murder, deceit, scams, and skimming, the FBI listened on phone taps and did virtually nothing to stop the fun. This book brings out the truth about the Mob's control of the cos in Vegas like you've never heard it before, from start to finish.\nEarly on, two of the nation's most powerful, dirty, and murderous crime family bosses went to prison in the 1930's: Al Capone, and Lucky Luciano. Frank Nitti took over the Chicago Outfit, while Frank Costello ran things for the Luciano Family. Both men were influenced by their bosses from prison, and both sent enough gangsters into the streets to influence loan sharking, extortion, union control, and drug sales.\nBugsy Siegel worked for both groups, handling a string of murders and opening up gaming on the west coast, and that included Las Vegas, an oasis of sin in the middle of the desert - and it was legal. Most of it. The FBI watched as the Mob took control of co after co, killed off the petition, and stole enough money to bribe their way to respectability back home.\nBy the 1950's, nearly every major crime family had a stake in a Las Vegas co. Some did better than others. Co owners watched-over their profits while peting crime families eyed each other's success like jealous lovers. Murder often followed.","The Skrill have destroyed Earth and now pursue the last Humans. Sixteen survive.

The likeable Doc of Stagecoach(1939) had audiences on the edge of their seats with dire warnings about \"that old butcher, Geronimo.\" Old Lodgeskins of Little Big Man(1970) had viewers crying out against the demise of the noble, wise chief and his kind and simple people.

Beginning with the birth of the movie industry, Jacquelyn Kilpatrick carefully traces changes in the cinematic depictions of Native peoples and identifies cultural and historical reasons for those changes.

In 'The Hope', his long-awaited return to historical fiction, he turns to one of the most thrilling stories of our time - the saga of Israel. In the grand, epic style of 'The Winds of War' and 'War and Remembrance',\n'The Hope' plunges the reader into the major battles, the disasters and victories, and the fragile periods of peace from the 1948 War of Independence to the astounding triumph of the Six-Day War in 1967. And since Israelis have seen their share of ic mishaps as well as heroism, this novel offers some of Herman Wouk's most amusing scenes since the famed \"strawberry business\" in 'The Caine Mutiny'.\nFirst to last 'The Hope' is a tale of four Israeli army officers and the women they love: Zev Barak, Viennese-born cultured military man; Benny Luria, ace fighter pilot with religious stirrings; Sam Pasternak, sardonic and mysterious Mossad man; and an antic dashing warrior they call Kishote, Hebrew for Quixote, who arrives at Israel's first pitched battle a refugee boy on a mule and over the years rises to high rank.\nIn the love stories of these four men, the author of 'Marjorie Morningstar' has created a gallery of three memorable Israeli women and one quirky fascinating American, daughter of a high CIA official and headmistress of a Washington girls school. With the authenticity, authority, and narrative force of Wouk's finest fiction, The Hope portrays not so much the victory of one people over another, as the gallantry of the human spirit, surviving and triumphing against crushing odds. In that sense it can be called a tale of hope for all mankind; a note that Herman Wouk has struck in all his writings, against the prevailing pessimism of our turbulent century.","'How Music Works' is David Byrne's remarkable and buoyant celebration of a subject he has spent a lifetime thinking about. In it he explores how profoundly music is shaped by its time and place, and he explains how the advent of recording technology in the twentieth century forever changed our relationship to playing, performing, and listening to music.\nActing as historian and anthropologist, raconteur and social scientist, he searches for patterns--and shows how those patterns have affected his own work over the years with Talking Heads and his many collaborators, from Brian Eno to Caetano Veloso. Byrne sees music as part of a larger, almost Darwinian pattern of adaptations and responses to its cultural and physical context. His range is panoptic, taking us from Wagnerian opera houses to African villages, from his earliest high school reel-to-reel recordings to his latest work in a home music studio (and all the big studios in between).\nTouching on the joy, the physics, and even the business of making music, 'How Music Works' is a brainy, irresistible adventure and an impassioned argument about music's liberating, life-affirming power.","On the Delta shuttle between New York and Washington, Rachel finds herself sitting next to Donald - six foot six, with dark wavy hair, a big easy smile.

He has done so mostly in silence because of fear of stigma. Extreme childhood bullying helped cause his condition, which has seen him hospitalized five times in psychiatric facilities for periods as long as six months.

Since their first appearance in 1963, they have simultaneously fascinated and terrified generations of children, their instant success ensuring, and sometimes eclipsing, that of Doctor Who. They sprang from the imagination of Terry Nation, a failed stand-up ic who became one of the most prolific writers for television that Britian ever produced. Survivors, his vision of a post-apocalyptic England, so haunted audiences in the Seventies that the BBC revived it over thirty years on, and Blake's 7, constantly rumored for return, endures as a cult sci-fi classic. But it is for his genocidal pepperpots that Nation is most often remembered, and on the 50th anniversary of their creation they continue to top the Saturday-night ratings. Yet while the Daleks brought him notoriety and riches, Nation played a much wider role in British broadcasting's golden age. He wrote for Spike Milligan, Frankie Howerd and an incregly troubled Tony Hancock, and as one of the key figures behind the adventure series of the Sixties - including The Avengers, The Saint and The Persuaders! - he turned the pulp classics of his boyhood into a major British export. In The Man Who Invented the Daleks, acclaimed cultural historian Alwyn W. Turner, explores the curious and contested origins of Doctor Who's greatest villains, and sheds light on a strange world of ambitious young writers, producers and performers without whom British culture today would look very different.","From generating ideas to gaining your first paying customers, The 7 Day Startup is the bootstrapper's bible for launching your next product.

Her head bobbed and she made choking and slurping noises but still tried her best to make the humming and hungry noises that Kate had seen her make in the video with her ex-husband. The stocky man was rough, grabbing her by her pageboy haircut and fucking her mouth like it was a pussy.","If you're interested in working in movies or making music and you were not privileged to be born the son or daughter of an already established named actor, writer, or musician that can open the door for you, then  is your guide.

But Mitch actually cares about justice more than his brother's bitchy fiancee (he's only working at the family firm at his sick father's request), and he quickly confounds Kate's expectations with his Rocky and Bullwinkle tie and \"tie-him-to-the-bed\" good looks. When the T.O.D. tries to lay the blame for her HR blunder on Kate, Mitch goes to the furthest reaches of lawyerly chivalry to save his ladylove. Studded with humorous details poking fun at social climbers and corporate drones,  is less a novel than a collection of lighthearted barbs, gleeful cliches and panicky (but ic and brief) freakouts. Cabot's 20-something fans will likely devour this fluffy, fun urban fairy tale.","Alternate-cover edition for ASIN: B00AFNO4ZE\nI can fly.\nI have to keep it a secret.\nEverything was fine, until I met him.\nI can't stay away...\nAurora Lockette has a supernatural ability she hides from the world.

More often than not I could be found with my nose buried in a book (many of which I had to sneak past my parents). It wasn't long before I started trying my hand at writing more of the stories I loved. After years of penning tales that rarely left the hard drive of my puter, I discovered M/M romance. As with all genres, it wasn't long before my own characters started to take shape.\nThere is little I love more than wandering new places and, on occasion, entirely new worlds with my characters. They can range from cowboys to Victorian noblemen, accountants to shapeshifters, and everything in between. I write mainly m/m romance, usually with paranormal or fantasy elements. I willingly follow my characters wherever they decide to go, sometimes with unusual results. I have little control over their actions, any naughty behaviour is all their doing!","An introduction to animal and their young who live all or part of their lives in water or that need water as a source of food.","It's the story \"They\" don't want you to read.

Do you?\nHere's a sample of the impactful words from God Called that have encouraged readers to take their Christianity to the next level:\nOur Christian walk is always about how much we trust and believe, and whether we trust God enough to put aside our fear. Each stage of our maturing in Christ depends on our ability to repent of our unbelief, or pride, and our idols, and move to the next stage. This is true from our first profession of faith. It is true when we start each new discipline. It is true when we bee aware of the depths of our sin and mindful of our need to be continually repenting. It is true when we bee willing to be pletely dependent on and open with God--intimate with Him. Then we must repent of our unbelief again if we are to fully surrender to a calling.\nDon't put off your decision to move closer to God and hear His voice.

The very model of blond Aryan \"purity,\" Irmgard sat on the Fuhrer's knee for photographers, witnessed with excitement the ings and goings of all manner of famous personages, and with the blindness of a child accepted the Nazi doctrine that most of her family and everyone around her so eagerly embraced. Here, in a picture-postcard world untouched by the war and seemingly unblemished by the horrors Germany's master had wrought, she accepted the lies of her teachers and church and civic leaders, joined the Hitler Youth at age ten, and joyfully sang the songs extolling the virtues of National Socialism.\nBut before the end -- when she and other children would be forced to cower in terror in dank bomb shelters and wartime deprivations would take a harrowing toll -- Irmgard's doubts about the \"truths\" she had been force-fed increased, fueled by the few brave souls who had not accepted Hitler and his abominations. After the fall of the brutal dictatorship and the suicide of its mad architect, many of her neighbors and loved ones still clung to their beliefs, prejudices, denial, and unacknowledged guilt. Irmgard, often feeling lonely in her quest, was determined to face the truth of her country's criminal past and to bear the responsibility for an almost unbearable reality that most of her elders were determined to forget. She resolved even then that the lessons of her youth would guide her actions and steel her mitment to defend the freedoms and democratic values that had been so easily dismissed by the German people.\nProvocative and astonishing, Irmgard A. Hunt's On Hitler's Mountain offers a unique, gripping, and vitally important first-person perspective on a tumultuous era in modern history, as viewed through the eyes of a child -- a candid and fascinating document, free of rationalization and whitewash, that chronicles the devastating moral collapse of a civilized nation.","Happy Tails Books is proud to be known as the country's leading publisher of short stories about rescued and adopted animals.

Yet in 1646, the Piarist order was abruptly abolished by Pope Innocent X. Fallen Order is the stunning story of how the sexual abuse of children, practiced by some of the leading priests in the order, led to the Piarists' collapse. Karen Liebreich spent several years researching in the order's archives and in the Vatican Secret Archive, and discovered how the founder of the Piarist Order, Father Jose de Calasanz (later honored as the patron saint of Catholic schools) knew of the scandal and tried to keep it a secret. Cardinals and bishops actively participated in the cover-up in an effort to protect the reputation of an important cleric with influential family connections. A brilliant portrait of seventeenth-century Rome, and the politics, personal rivalries, and Byzantine workings of the Vatican and the Catholic Church, Fallen Order is an explosive account of a history of cover-ups, deception, and shuttling known abuser priests from school to school that is frighteningly similar to the Catholic Church's response to child abuse in the priesthood today.","\"One day I'll ride a bicycle.

The secrecy involved in the Underground Railroad made it one of the most mysterious aspects of the mid-19th century in America, to the extent that claims spread that 100,000 slaves had escaped via the Underground Railroad. Of course, from a practical standpoint, the Underground Railroad had to remain covert not only for the sake of thousands of slaves, but for a small army of men and women of every race, religion and economic class who put themselves in peril on an ongoing basis throughout the first half of the 19th century, and in the years leading up to the war.\nOver 150 years later, that same secrecy has helped the Underground Railroad bee so romanticized and mythologized that people often visualize it in ways that were far different from reality. Before the American Civil War eliminated slavery, it was a fixture in North America for over 200 years, and by 1850 a trained slave was worth approximately $2,500, around 10 times the sum of a typical annual salary in that day. As a result, the economic dependence on slavery in the South was an extreme one, and in the wake of the Fugitive Slave Act, black people in the North were under constant pressure to defend their \"credentials\" to bounty hunters and owners. Between the value of slaves in America, rising abolitionist sentiment at home and overseas, and political debates promoting or hindering the movement toward equality, the era in which the Underground Railroad operated cannot be easily fit into a concise body of principles, actions or geography.\nHilary Russell may have put it best in saying of the Underground Railroad that while \"a powerful and centralized system may not have existed but in legend, localized networks did.\" Communication standards over long distances being what they were in that century, she is most likely correct. The Underground Railroad was neither a true railroad nor underground, and it was not a route but a network prised of a widespread conspiracy and social rebellion against present law. For the most part, people working on the Underground Railroad tried to protect themselves by not knowing the full details of the routes they were working on; instead, many people just played individual parts for the greater good.\nThe Underground Railroad: The History and Legacy of America's Abolitionist Network prehensively examines the history of the Underground Railroad, explaining how it operated and who worked for it, as well as the political history that made it necessary for escaped slaves. Along with pictures of important people, places, and events, you will learn about the Underground Railroad like never before, in no time at all.","THE FINAL BATTLE!

Few of them have been studied, even fewer have received critical attention. Those in question, ranging from historical & mythological epics to adaptations of ancient drama, burlesques, animated cartoons & documentaries, suggest a preoccupation with antiquity that petes in intensity & breadth with that of Hollywood's classical era.

Affixed to each Voyager craft was a gold-coated copper phonograph record as a message to possible extra-terrestrial civilizations that might encounter the spacecraft in some distant space and time.

This is evident in the Quran (ali-Imran, verse 19).\nYes, they do say 'Islam' is peace, but what many do not realise is the obscurity surrounding this word, which has fooled the people for ages and that the conspirators have successfully turned it into a brand name for a religion (not ordained by the God).\n\"They have taken their priests and rabbis as lords besides the God, as well as Christ the son of Mary. They were manded not to serve, but the one God; there is no god except He, much too glorious to have partners\".\nQ9:31\nIt is important that mankind accept the responsibility that they have allowed themselves to be duped and misled over thousands of years to be the slaves and toys of those who would control them. The plan to hold them in this deplorable condition has been one carefully implemented since man has been allowed to \"rule himself\". That these human rulers were/are carefully controlled is absolutely true. By absenting themselves, the true rulers have hidden their influence behind blind faith augmented by cruel punishment for disobedience meted out by \"a God of love\". The paradox of this claim has kept mankind in a constant turmoil and exactly where it was planned that they be.","Ten months ago, Spade was won in yet another high-stakes poker game. But Ace Donovan was different from his previous masters--kind, generous, possessed of a playfulness that only Spade could see. His new master was also broken, slowly crumbling under the pressures of undeserved guilt and pain. As Senai--a genetically engineered servant--Spade had the ability to sweep the anguish from his soul, to fulfill his every desire, and to set Ace's spirit free.\nHe had not known doing these things would grant him the human's love, or create an answering emotion within him.\nThere is no greater pleasure than Ace in his arms, and Spade will hold on for as long as he is wanted.

Evil spirits, malefic gods whose memory lives on in whispered legends and fear-stricken superstitions, still lurk in vile catabs beneath the surface of a blighted land. Ward is driven to unleash these loathsome horrors upon a defenceless world, possessed by the demonic shade of his ancestor Joseph Curwen, a warlock steeped in the blackest arts of magic. Now Ward too must master these obscene rituals, and pay the price in blood. Human blood.

It is apparently a catechism, intended to provide basic instruction in the Christian lifestyle and worship for persons preparing for baptism.The Didache exhibits fascinating echoes of Jesus' teaching in its Matthean form, along with rare glimpses into the life of an early Christian munity -- its values, its observance of the Eucharist, its leaders, and the character of its hope.\nNiederwimmer's wonderful mentary is a model of clarity and learning and a splendid addition to this premier mentary series.","In a small town in Cornwall, a fighter and a schoolteacher meet.\nDangerous.

Yo no escribo aqui historia contemporanea. Pero si quiero dejar constancia de mi amargura, mas fuerte de lo que nunca habia imaginado poder sentir\". Son las palabras iniciales de las mas de mil quinientas paginas que pletan unos diarios llevados en riguroso secreto durante los anos de la dictadura nazi, salvados milagrosamente de la guerra y del exterminio judio. Estos diarios permanecieron ocultos durante decadas hasta que un antiguo discipulo de Klemperer los descubrio y edito hace unos anos en Alemania.\n-------------------------\nLos diarios que resenamos ienzan el 14 de enero de 1933 y finalizan el 10 de junio de 1945. Durante estos largos anos, Victor Klemperer, casado con una mujer \"aria\", Eva Schlemmer, anota con perseverancia y sobriedad las vejaciones y humillaciones sufridas bajo el Tercer Reich: la expulsion de su catedra, las expropiaciones, la prohibicion de consultar bibliotecas o visitar jardines, las obligadas mudanzas a Casas Judias, la imposicion de trabajos forzados, la estigmatizacion, la constante e imprevisible amenaza de deportacion y exterminio, la idiocia e impiedad de vecinos germanos o judios ante la ignominia y el desafuero, pero sin ocultar los escasos gestos de generosidad de la poblacion alemana.\nSon memorables las paginas dedicadas a la tormenta de fuego que asolo la ciudad de Dresde el 13 de febrero de 1945 bajo las miles de toneladas de bombas incendiarias arrojadas por las fortalezas volantes britanicas; azar que posibilito a la pareja Klemperer su desesperada fuga hacia Munich a traves de las ruinas de una Alemania desolada y proxima a la derrota. Entranable es el cuidado mutuo que se prestan ambos en los momentos de fragilidad, su costumbre de leer en voz alta, el amor a los gatos y al cine, su cercania al humor y los chistes de las victimas. Y sin embargo los analisis introspectivos de Klemperer no se ahorran ajustes de cuentas consigo mismo, el interlocutor mas cruel, rasgo tipico del diarista educado en la fe protestante que al no contar con el sacramento de la confesion no se engana tan facilmente con indulgencias.\nGracias a esta sinceridad en absoluto autoplaciente, Klemperer reconoce a menudo o la sensacion de poder que confiere el instante de la supervivencia suele imponerse a los estados de duelo y pasion. El paulatino proceso de desmantelamiento interno de su identidad alemana, el conflicto entre la imposibilidad y la necesidad de ser judio, el descubrimiento de o el vencido respira y vive segun el lenguaje del vencedor (sin llegar tan lejos o Barthes que afirmo que todo lenguaje es \"fascista\", pues por su estructura implica una relacion fatal de obediencia y alienacion), la renuncia a todo consuelo filosofico o religioso sobre la invio-\nlabilidad de la dignidad interior, todo ello aproxima la obra de Victor Klemperer a la de Jean Amery. Ciertamente, el lector no se sentira defraudado por este tesoro de memoria, coraje civico e ilustracion.\n-------------------------\nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933, Victor Klemperer (1881-1960), honored as a frontline veteran of World War I, was a distinguished professor at the University of Dresden. A scant few months later he was merely a Jew, protected from deportation to a death camp only by his marriage to an Aryan. He suffered every other indignity to which German Jews were subjected, from losing his job to having his driver's license revoked to being denied permission to own a pet, and all are recorded with bitter clarity in his diary entries, which cover the years 1933 to 1941. (A second volume continuing through 1945 will be published in English in 1999.) The German edition of  caused a sensation when it was published in 1995, and it's easy to see why: the relentless, quotidian nature of Nazi racism es through forcefully in Klemperer's litany of daily humiliations and insults, a painful chronicle of situations in which readers can readily imagine themselves. Like Anne Frank, but with a more adult understanding of political fanaticism and human weakness, he makes the abstract horror of genocidal persecution very intimate, very personal, and very real. --Wendy Smith","New York Timesbestselling author Carla Neggers returns with this absorbing, twisting tale of suspense, romance and fast-paced action, the latest in her popular Sharpe & Donovan series.\nEmma Sharpe and Colin Donovan, two of the FBI's most valuable agents, are preparing for their next big assignment--their wedding--when Colin's brother Mike alerts them that onetime friends from his military past are on Sharpe and Donovan home turf on the Maine coast.

Chaput O.F.M. Cap., Archbishop of Denver For over two decades John Green's vocation has been ministering to inner-city men on the margins of society. Green didn't set out to be another Dorothy Day or Mother Teresa, and would be quick to tell you he hasn't bee one. Struck by the words of Micah 6:8 and the act of a homeless man who gruesomely ended his life in Green's presence, Green vowed to constantly ask himself: How can I live justly? To whom do I show mercy? How may I walk humbly with God? Green shares the lessons he learned regarding these hard questions through the stories of men who struggle to escape poverty, addiction, and sexual sin -- while encountering Christ in the process. But  is much more than the account of how his Emmaus Ministries bats a social problem to which most of us wish to remain blind. It is about finding joy in service to others and experiencing love in reaching out to the suffering, all under the shelter of God's unconquerable, abiding love. Yes, Streetwalking with Jesus will sober you, but with links to free, online songs, a Scripture selection to reflect upon, discussion questions, and a prayer at the end of every chapter, you'll e away challenged and inspired to live a deeper, more mission-based life. \"John Green is the real deal. His words and lifestyle of passion ooze from these pages. The stories break our hearts. You have left your mark on me.\" -- Dr. John Fuder, Professor of Urban Studies, Moody Theological Seminary, Chicago Table of Contents: Endorsements Foreword by Francis Cardinal George, O.M.I.

Its inclement weather and perilous tides have made it a playground and a proving ground, a nursery and a grave, an object of veneration and a mighty adversary. A sea like no other, it has shaped our modern world and yet remained the same ancient beast known to the earliest inhabitants of its shores.\nIn North Sea, journalist Tom Blass trawls the bottom and skims the waves of the North Sea, searching for all that glistens, enraptures, enrages, and appalls.

But when he fails to control the book's most treacherous spell, it sets off a deadly chain of events that rocks Taper Academy to its core.\nAlthough Demetry's crime is punishable by death, the Arcane Council inexplicably spares Demetry's life. Instead of being sent to the gallows, he is sent to Coljack, a fortress prison built to house the kingdom's most dangerous criminals.

The play premiered in Chicago in 1944, & in 1945 won the prestigious NY Drama Critics Circle Award. It was his 1st successful play; he went on to bee one of America's most highly regarded playwrights.\nThe play was reworked from one of Williams's short stories \"Portrait of a Girl in Glass\" (written 6/1943, published 1948).

From his awful head wise Zeus himself bare her arrayed in warlike arms of flashing gold, and awe seized all the gods as they gazed. But Athena sprang quickly from the immortal head and stood before Zeus who holds the aegis, shaking a sharp spear: great Olympus began to reel horribly at the might of the bright-eyed goddess, and earth round about cried fearfully, and the sea was moved and tossed with dark waves, while foam burst forth suddenly...\" - \"The Hymn To Athena\", attributed to Homer\nFor the ancient Greeks, there were few divine beings more important, and more generous, to humanity than the goddess Athena, who was also called \"Pallas,\" \"Pallas Athena\" and (to the Romans) \"Minerva.\" The daughter of Zeus, Athena was famous as a virgin warrior woman who was born from her father's skull bearing a helmet, shield and spear, but she was far more than simply a warrior goddess. She was at heart the patronage of civilization and all of the arts that made advanced human society possible. She was the mistress of weaving, navigation, craftsmanship, and she gave her patronage to defensive wars, wise laws, and the \"city\" itself. Since the city-state, known as a \"Polis\" by the Greeks, was the center of Ancient Greek life, law and politics, this made her all the more important as a deity, especially since she lent her name to one of the most famous of them all: Athens.\nThe pervasive nature of her influence in the Greeks' everyday life has ensured that Athena remains one of the most instantly recognizable goddesses. She is mentioned in diverse works like Hesiod's Theogony, Homer's Iliad and Odyssey and several of Plato's philosophical texts. These works shine light on what contemporary Greeks said about their goddess and how they understood the relationship she had with humanity. At the same time, there were temples, festivals, and everyday forms of worship that the Greeks dedicated to her. What did the worship of this goddess provide for her worshipers? How did belief in her existence fulfill their spiritual needs? How was she different from other members of the Greek pantheon?\nThis book explores the figure of Athena, including her origins, the stories told about her, the way she was worshiped and how she is remembered today. Along with pictures and a bibliography, you will learn about the Greek goddess like you never have before, in no time at all.","College student Hannah Maquiling, also temporarily working as the Goddess of Love, has had enough of everyone asking for her help when it es to relationships.

From Malibu Pier to the Hollywood Sign, from Union Station to the Beverly Hills Hotel, from MGM Studios to Musso and Frank's Grill, these locales form the geography of Chandler's imagination, and conjure a world not yet entirely vanished. Clive James wrote of Chandler's fascination with Los Angeles that \"when he said that it had as much personality as a paper cup, he was saying what he liked about it.\" But Chandler was also drawn to the Hopperesque loneliness of the city, to that sense of isolate existences that never merge. In these photographs, Catherine Corman (editor of \"Joseph Cornell's Dreams\") has given us, as Jonathan Lethem writes in his preface, \"a supremely evocative catalogue of haunted places... these streets and buildings we have erected in order to give order to our solitudes.\"","For Tyler Donovan, moving to the oceanfront town of Destin Florida meant a new job and hopefully new adventures with his lifelong friend and fellow vampire, Drake Landon.\nThe young doctors are set to take over Ty's fathers medical practice.

The Nazis pursued propaganda not just as a tool, an instrument of government, but also as the totality, the raison d'etre, the medium through which power itself was exercised. Moreover, Nicholas O'Shaughnessy argues, Hitler, not Goebbels, was the prime mover in the propaganda regime of the Third Reich - its editor and first author.\nUnder the Reich everything was a propaganda medium, a building-block of public consciousness, from typography to muniques, to architecture, to weapons design. There were groups to initiate rumours and groups to spread graffiti. Everything could be interrogated for its propaganda potential, every surface inscribed with polemical meaning, whether an enemy city's name, an historical epic or the poster on a neighbourhood wall. But Hitler was in no sense an innovator - his ideas were always second-hand. Rather his expertise was as a packager, fashioning from the accumulated mass of icons and ideas, the historic debris, the labyrinths and byways of the German mind, a modern and brilliant political show articulated through deftly managed symbols and rituals. The Reich would have been unthinkable without propaganda - it would not have been the Reich.\n\"","Great Uncle Bulgaria loves telling the ancient and revered history of the Womble clans to the younger Wombles.

Yet in spite of its sometimes inferior status amongst academics, biography has remained a popular genre, and in recent years has developed into new and intriguing areas. As the essays in this volume reveal, scholars from an array of different disciplines have embraced what biography can offer them, expanding the remit of biography from people to things, tracing the 'life' of their chosen object from creation to use to disposal to rediscovery. The increg concern with the physicality of manuscripts and books has also meant an awareness of and interest in the 'lives' of these forms of material culture. Historians have also bee incregly interested in groups of individuals resulting in prosopographical studies. A book on the diversity of biography is therefore very timely, exploring the multi-disciplinary application of historical biography in the period 500-1700. It presents fourteen case studies offering new approaches to historical biography, written by early-career researchers from backgrounds in archaeology, English, art, architectural history and history, demonstrating different approaches and techniques. Overall, the collection is a strong and united statement by a group of early-career researchers who insist on the vitality of biography as a central concern of historians across the disciplines of the humanities. Contributors believe that the 'life' is a fundamental medium of study for the medieval and early modern periods, and thus . bolsters the move back towards biography as a primary tool of medieval and early modern scholars, as well as a tool for future research for humanities scholars interested in biography.","Praise for USA Today bestselling author Connie Shelton and the Charlie Parker mysteries: \"Fans of Southwestern mysteries will find that Shelton's engaging story, likable heroine, and fortable prose make this a good choice.\" - Library Journal \"Charlie is slick, appealing and nobody's fool.\" -- Booklist Charlie is invited to a plush Santa Fe spa, a week-long spiritual/nutrition retreat with her friend Dr. Linda Casper.

Why did so many leading literary figures attempt the genre with varying degrees of success? Who were the female ghost story writers, many now unjustly neglected, who made such a huge contribution to the genre?\nBetween 1820 and 1950, a period known today as the golden age of British ghost fiction, the traditional ghostly tale was adopted as a mainstream literary form by many of the foremost writers of the era, reaching a level of mastery that many believe remains unmatched to this day. That a number of leading literary figures took the genre seriously and were keen to grapple with and master the form is testament to the challenges it posed and how fiendishly difficult it is to write successful ghost fiction.\nNewers to the genre may be pleasantly surprised by the skill, subtlety and psychological insight displayed by the master ghost story writers. The finest examples transcend the genre and take their place among the best of our classic literature.\nFemale authors made a vital contribution to the genre and many are included in this volume. Here, for example, you will find E. Nesbit, famous today as the author of the perennially popular novel, The Railway Children; the mysterious Lettice Galbraith about whom little is known, but whose ghost story fiction is regarded by some as among the best ever written; Dorothy Macardle, a prominent figure in Irish literary society who wrote her first ghost stories while in prison in 1922 for nationalist activities; and the wonderfully named Wilhelmina Fitzclarence, Countess of Munster, who published her first book when she was nearly sixty.\nThis volume explores the contribution made by leading and lesser-known authors to the ghost story genre. It features biographical information about all the authors covered as well as additional fascinating material including the ghost story master M. R. James' essay about ghost story fiction; an entry on the mysterious 'B'; a list of remended short stories; and a brief overview of research into supernatural phenomena and some of the more famous first-hand accounts of ghostly encounters.\nNeil Wilson, author of the definitive British ghost story bibliography, Shadows in the Attic (British Library, 2000) provides authoritative and extensive introductory notes, including a history of the supernatural from ancient to modern times; an analysis of the evolution of the ghost story; and an exploration of mon themes and topics in supernatural fiction.\nNote:\nGhost Writings offers an invaluable introduction to the genre piled with the aim of inspiring the reader to explore further. It concentrates particularly on the rich heritage of British ghost fiction, and for this reason American authors in the genre are not included. It should also be noted that the selected bibliographies included with author details are not prehensive and often include publications that are now out of print; they are mentioned solely for historical interest. However, many of these works are now widely available in new print and electronic editions and can be readily found on Amazon.","What if the people who thought they were better than you... really were?\nIn this world, inequality is a science.

The creed of this religion included the exacting teachings of Calvinism, which allowed no room to question anything the Bible said. As a result, the congregation lived severe lives, totally judgmental of anyone who sinned as the Bible described it, and obedience to God was more important than love or passion for sinners.\nAs the author grew up and reading the Bible daily, which was a family practice, he realized that the God of Christianity was a God of wrath and love often demanded of Moses the death of other countries that the Jews passed through. Particularly, it bothered the author when God demanded Abraham to kill his son as a sacrifice. This memoir is the story of his path of pain and confusion that he traveled even into his now advanced age of 76. Through his early years as a minister after spending hours trying to reconcile these condemnations and judgments, even unto death, he could not give up the Bible and he spent hours, searching himself and others to try to justify the viciousness of the orders of God, which many modern day churches still follow. When in the pulpit, he attempted to by-step some of the verses of the Bible and interpret them differently. But he was talking to congregations raised in this judgmental pathway and they would plain until he had to leave as minister.\nAs time passed and he continue to attempt to justify those unloving parts of the Bible, he never really could and because he wanted to use the Church as a place of love and passion, he began to take college courses in psychology, but at the same time, had to find churches who were more liberal. He was most stubborn in his determination to convince others, especially ministers, that fundamentalism was not the message that Jesus was sending, but it didn't work. Since he was a man and stubborn, he suffered much emotionally and mentally, even making enemies of his family.\nThis is a good book for Christians who also cannot relax with a God of wrath and love as promoted in many Churches of Christianity and perhaps find solace in the suffering of this man.\nI was given a plimentary copy of  for an honest review.","Listening Length: 7 hours and 22 minutes\nThe rugged men of the Carolina Cold Fury hockey team are winning hearts once again in another scorching novel from New York Timesbestselling author Sawyer Bennett.\nThe stakes have never been higher for Carolina Cold Fury goalie Ryker Evans.

And yet it has excused, and even been thought to justify, the most reprehensible crimes. Why should this be? This Very Short Introduction explores this and other puzzling questions. Do we love someone for their virtue, their beauty, or their moral or other qualities? Are love's characteristic desires altruistic or selfish? Are there duties of love? What do the sciences - neuroscience, evolutionary and social psychology, and anthropology - tell us about love?\nMany of the answers we give to such questions are determined not so much by the facts of human nature as by the ideology of love. Ronald de Sousa considers some of the many paradoxes raised by love, looking at the different kinds of love - affections, affiliation, philia, storage, agape, but focusses on eros, or romantic love. He considers whether our conventional beliefs about love and sex are deeply irrational and argues that alternative conceptions of love and sex, although hard to formulate and live by, may be worth striving for.\nABOUT THE SERIES:\nThe Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors bine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable.","How far would you go to help a close friend?
