Doch dann zogen Doras Eltern nach Frankreich, und Luka blieb allein zuruck. Als Mittzwanziger treffen sie sich nun uberraschend in Paris wieder, und es ist klar: Sie gehoren einfach zusammen. Drei gluckliche Monate folgen, aus denen ein gemeinsames Leben werden soll; nur kurz will Luka in die Heimat zuruck, um ein paar Dinge in Ordnung zu bringen - und dann meldet er sich nicht mehr. Jeden Tag, jede Stunde ist eine jener aussergewohnlichen Liebesgeschichten, die zugleich zeitlos und modern sind: zeitlos in ihrem Glauben an die Vorbestimmtheit, mit der zwei Menschen ein Schicksal teilen, und modern in ihrem Wissen, dass das Leben sich als viel schwieriger erweist.\nEin Liebesroman, wie er sein sollte: poetisch, von grosser emotionaler Strahlkraft, mitreissend erzahlt.","This short story, set in 1879 San Francisco, features two elderly dressmakers, Miss Minnie and Miss Millie Moffet, who face a moral dilemma of no small dimensions. They turn for advice to Annie Fuller, a widowed boardinghouse owner who supplements her ine as a clairvoyant, Madam Sibyl.\nFor those who have read Locke's two full-length Victorian San Francisco mysteries, Maids of Misfortune and Uneasy Spirits, and her other short story, Dandy Detects, this is an amusing glimpse into the lives of Annie Fuller's two most eccentric boarders. For those unfamiliar with Locke's mysteries and the late nineteenth century world they portray, this is just a taste of things to e.","Against a vivid backdrop of history, Danielle Steel tells a pelling story of love and war, acts of faith and acts of betrayal...and of three generations of women as they journey though years of loss and survival, linked by an indomitable devotion that echoes across time.\nFor the Wittgenstein family, the summer of 1915 was a time of both prosperity and unease, as the guns of war sound in the distance. But for eldest daughter Beata, it was also a summer of awakening. By the glimmering waters of Lake Geneva, the quiet Jewish beauty met a young French officer and fell in love. Knowing that her parents would never accept her marriage to a Catholic, Beata followed her heart anyway. And as the two built a new life together, Beata's past would stay with her in ways she could never have predicted. For as the years pass, and Europe is once again engulfed in war, Beata must watch in horror as Hitler's terror threatens her life and family--even her eighteen-year-old daughter Amadea, who has taken on the vows of a Carmelite nun.\nFor Amadea, the convent is no refuge. As family and friends are swept away without a trace, Amadea is forced into hiding. Thus begins a harrowing journey of survival, as she escapes into the heart of the French Resistance. Here Amadea will find a renewed sense of purpose, taking on the most daring missions behind enemy lines. And it is here, in the darkest moments of fear, that Amadea will feel her mother's loving strength--and that of her mother's mother before her-as the voices of lost loved ones echo powerfully in her heart. And here, amid the fires of war, Amadea will meet an extraordinary man, British secret agent Rupert Montgomery. In Colonel Montgomery, Amadea finds a man who will help her discover her place in an unbreakable chain between generations...and between her lost family and her dreams for the future--a future she is only just beginning to imagine: a future of hope rooted in the rich soil of the past.\nWith the grace of a master storyteller, Danielle Steel breathes life into history, creating a bold, sweeping tale filled with unforgettable characters and breathtaking images--from the elegant rituals of Europe's prewar aristocracy to the brutal desperation of Germany's death camps. Drawing us into a vanished world, Echoes weaves an intricate tapestry of a mother's love, a daughter's courage...and the unwavering faith that sustained them--even in history's darkest hour.\nFrom the Hardcover edition.","The last place you'd expect to find a team of criminals is at a prestigious Philadelphia prep school. But on a class trip to the U.S. Mint - which prints a million new coins every 30 minutes - an overlooked security flaw bees far too tempting for a small group of students to ignore. United by dire circumstances, these unlikely allies - the nerd, the slacker, the athlete, and the perfect student - band together to attempt the impossible: rob the U.S. Mint. This diverse crew is forced to confront their true beliefs about each other and themselves as they do the wrong thing for the right reasons. Elisa Ludwig's COIN HEIST is a fun, suspenseful and pelling thriller, told from the revolving perspectives of four teens, each with their own motive for mitting a crime that will change their all of their lives - if they can pull it off.\n\"Jackpot! Smartly plotted, morally fascinating, and featuring the most engaging crew of prep school outlaws, Elisa Ludwig's COIN HEIST is a heist story with heart.\" -- Diana Renn, author of Tokyo Heist and Latitude Zero\n\"COIN HEIST is indeed a tale of an epic break-in at the Philadelphia Mint. But that's only half the story. The other half is a touching ing-of-age story and the third half is a wonderful character study of teenage life in America as it's lived now. Look, maybe I'm not good at math and maybe three-halves is impossible. Or maybe COIN HEIST is just that good.\" -- Josh Berk, Edgar Award finalist and author of The Dark Days of Hamburger Halpin and Guy Langman: Crime Scene Procrastinator","The noted Stanford University psychiatrist distills the essence of a wide range of therapies into a masterful, creative synthesis, opening up a new way of understanding each person's confrontation with four ultimate concerns: isolation, meaninglessness, death, and freedom.","First in the Farmer's Market Mystery Series.\nBecca Robins leads a simple life, making jams and preserves on her very own farm.

But far more than the riveting account of a break-in, this is a daring exploration of place and the boundaries upon which identities are mapped.\nAs a child growing up in apartheid South Africa, Gevisser bees obsessed with a street guide called Holmden's Register of Johannesburg, which literally erases entire black townships. Johannesburg, he realizes, is full of divisions between black and white, rich and poor, gay and straight; a place that \"draws its energy precisely from its atomization and its edge, its stacking of boundaries against one another.\" Here, Gevisser embarks on a quest to understand the inner life of his city.\nGevisser uses maps, family photographs, shards of memory, newspaper clippings, and courtroom testimony to chart his intimate history of Johannesburg. He begins by tracing his family's journey from the Orthodox world of a Lithuanian shtetl to the white suburban neighborhoods where separate servants' quarters were legally required at every house. Gevisser, who eventually marries a black man, tells stories of others who have learned to define themselves \"within, and across, and against,\" the city's boundaries. He recalls the double lives of gay men like Phil and Edgar, the ever-present housekeepers and gardeners, and the private swimming pools where blacks and whites could be discreetly intimate, even though the laws of apartheid strictly prohibited sex between people of different races. And he explores physical barriers like The Wilds, a large park that divides Johannesburg's affluent Northern Suburbs from two of its poorest neighborhoods. It is this park that the three men who held Gevisser at gunpoint crossed the night of their crime.\nAn ode to both the marked and unmarked landscape of Gevisser's past, Lost and Found inJohannesburg is an existential guide to one of the most plex cities on earth. As Gevisser writes, \"Maps would have no purchase on us, no currency at all, if we were not in danger of running aground, of getting lost, of dislocation and even death without them. All maps awaken in me a desire to be lost and to be found . . . [They force] me to remember something I must never allow myself to forget: Johannesburg, my hometown, is not the city I think I know.\"","Pulsing with the dark obsession of Radiohead's song \"Creep,\" this taut thriller--Jennifer Hillier's superb debut--rockets from its seductive opening to a heartpounding climax not easily forgotten.\nIf he can't have her . . .\nDr. Sheila Tao is a professor of psychology. An expert in human behavior. And when she began an affair with sexy, charming graduate student Ethan Wolfe, she knew she was playing with fire. Consumed by lust when they were together, riddled with guilt when they weren't, she knows the three-month fling with her teaching assistant has to end. After all, she's finally engaged to a kind and loving investment banker who adores her, and she's taking control of her life. But when she attempts to end the affair, Ethan Wolfe won't let her walk away.\n. . . no one else can.\nEthan has plans for Sheila, plans that involve posting a sex video that would surely get her fired and destroy her prestigious career. Plans to make her pay for rejecting him. And as she attempts to counter his every threatening move without her colleagues or her fiance discovering her most intimate secrets, a shattering crime rocks Puget Sound State University: a female student, a star athlete, is found stabbed to death. Someone is raising the stakes of violence, sex, and blackmail . . . and before she knows it, Sheila is caught in a terrifying cat-and-mouse game with the lover she couldn't resist--who is now the monster who won't let her go.","Adamine Bustamante is born in one of Jamaica's last leper colonies. When Adamine grows up, she discovers she has the gift of \"warning\": the power to protect, inspire, and terrify. But when she is sent to live in England, her prophecies of impending disaster are met with a different kind of fear--people think she is insane and lock her away in a mental hospital. Now an older woman, the spirited Adamine wants to tell her story. But she must wrestle for the truth with the mysterious \"Mr. Writer Man,\" who has a tale of his own to share, one that will cast Adamine's life in an entirely new light. In a story about magic and migration, stories and storytelling, and the New and Old Worlds, we discover it is never one person who owns a story or has the right to tell it.","\"Maddie knew she was dying.

But can we save the prince before he's wrongfully crowned \"criminal\"?","\"The press has bee a tool of oppression--politicized, self-aware, self-motivated, and power-hungry. . . . In short, these people can no longer be trusted.\" --From S. E. Cupp's Losing Our Religion\nIt's time to wake up and smell the bias. The go-to mentator for such programs as Fox News's Hannity and CNN's Larry King Live and Reliable Sources, S. E. Cupp is just that--a reliable source for the latest news, trends, and forecasts in young, bright, conservative America. Savvy and outspoken when shattering left-leaning assumptions as she did in Why You're Wrong About the Right, Cupp now takes on the most pressing threat to the values and beliefs held and practiced by the majority of Americans: the marginalizing of Christianity by the flagrantly biased liberal media.\nFrom her galvanizing introduction, you know where S. E. Cupp stands: She's an atheist. A non-believer. Which makes her the perfect impartial reporter from the trenches of a culture war dividing America and eroding the Judeo-Christian values on which this country was founded. Starting at the top, she exposes the unwitting courtship of President Obama and the liberal press, which consistently misreports or downplays Obama's clear disfort with, or blatant disregard for, religious America--from covering up religious imagery in the backdrop of his Georgetown University speech to his absence from events surrounding the National Day of Prayer, to identifying America in his inaugural address as, among other things, \"a nation of non-believers.\" She likens the calculated attacks of the liberal media to a class war, a revolution with a singular purpose: to overthrow God and silence Christian America for good. And she sends out an urgent call for all Americans to push back the leftist propaganda blitz striking on the Internet, radio, television, in films, publishing, and print journalism--or invite the tyrannies of a \"mainstream\" media set on mocking our beliefs, controlling our decisions, and extinguishing our freedoms.\nNow, discover the truth behind the war against Christmas--and how political correctness keeps the faithful under wraps . . . the one-sided analyses of Prop 8 and the gay marriage debate . . . the media pot-shots at Sarah Palin's personal faith . . . the politicization of entertainment mainstays such as American Idol and the Miss USA Pageant . . . and much more. Also included are her penetrating interviews with Dinesh D'Souza, Martha Zoller, James T. Harris, Newt Gingrich, Kevin Madden, and Kevin Williamson of National Review, delivering must-read analyses of the latest stunning lowlights from the liberal media.","To Persians, the fourteenth-century poems of Hafiz are not classical literature from a remote past, but cherished love, wisdom, and humor from a dear and intimate friend.

Each bears a single gunshot wound to the head. The female victim has also been impaled by a metal spike. And that savage stroke of psychopathic fury tells Milo this case will call for more than standard police procedure.

And that means going head-to-head with Dr. Mary Lou Koppel, a popular celebrity psychologist who fiercely guards the privacy of her clients . . . dead or alive.\nBut when there's another gruesomely familiar murder, Delaware surmises that his investigation has struck a nerve. As he trolls the twisted wreckage of Quick's tormented last days, what he finds isn't madness, but the cold-blooded method behind it.

An enthralling narrative brilliantly told.","From the early years of fur trading to today's Silicon Valley empires, America has proved to be an extraordinarily fertile land for the creation of enormous fortunes. Each generation has produced one or two phenomenally successful leaders, often in new industries that caught contemporaries by surprise, and each of these new fortunes reconfirmed the power of fanatically single-minded visionaries. John Jacob Astor and Cornelius Vanderbilt were the first American moguls; John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and J. P. Morgan were kingpins of the Gilded Age; David Sarnoff, Walt Disney, Ray Kroc, and Sam Walton were masters of mass culture. Today Oprah Winfrey, Andy Grove, and Bill Gates are giants of the Information Age. America has again and again been the land of dizzying mountains of wealth. Here, in a wittily told and deeply insightful history, is a plete set of portraits of America's greatest generators of wealth. Only such a collective study allows us to appreciate what makes the great entrepreneurs really tick. As H. W. Brands shows, these men and women are driven, they are focused, they deeply identify with the businesses they create, and they possess the charisma necessary to persuade other talented people to join them. They do it partly for the money, but mostly for the thrill of creation.\nThe stories told here -- including how Nike got its start as a business-school project for Phil Knight; how Robert Woodruff almost refused to take control of Coca-Cola to spite his father; how Thomas Watson saved himself from prison by rescuing Dayton, Ohio, from a flood; how Jay Gould nearly cornered the gold market; how H. L. Hunt went from gambling at cards to gambling with oilleases -- make for a narrative that is always lively and revealing and often astonishing. An observer in 1850, studying John Jacob Astor, would not have predicted the rise of Henry Ford and the auto industry. Nor would a student of Ford in 1950 have anticipated the takeoff of direct marketing that made Mary Kay Ash a trusted guide for millions of American women. Full of surprising insights, written with H. W. Brands's trademark flair, the stories in \"Masters of Enterprise\" are must reading for all students of American business history.","Called on a stormy day to his first murder scene as the new mander of investigations, Inspector Avraham Avraham is astounded to discover he knows the victim: a middle-aged woman who had been assaulted in the past.

It was one of the most devastating human disasters in history.\n\"The bodies were sparsely covered that the dogs dragged them forth and devoured them . And believing it to be the end of the world, no one wept for the dead, for all expected to die.\" Agnolo di Turo, Siena, 1348\nIn just over 1000 days from 1347 to 1351 the 'Black Death' swept across medieval Europe killing 30% of it's population. It was a catastrophe that touched the lives of every individual on the continent. The deadly Y. Pestis virus entered Europe by Genoese galley at Messina, Sicily in October 1347. By the spring of 1348 it was devastating the cities of central Italy, by June 1348 it had swept in to France and Spain, and by August it had reached England. One graphic testimony can be found at St Mary's, Ashwell, Hertfordshire, where an anonymous hand carved a harrowing inscription for 1349: 'Wretched, terrible, destructive year, the remnants of the people alone remain.'\nAccording to the Foster scale, a kind of Richter scale of human disaster, the plague of 1347-51 is the second worst catastrophe in recorded history. Only World War II produced more death, physical damage, and emotional suffering. It is also the closest thing that Defence Analysts pare a thermonuclear war to - in geographical extent, abruptness and casualties.\nIn The Great MortalityJohn Kelly retraces the journey of the Black Death using original source material - diary fragments, letters, manuscripts - as it swept across Europe. It is harrowing portrait of a continent gripped by an epidemic, but also a very personal story narrated by the individuals whose lives were touched by it.","Dan Savage's nationally syndicated sex advice column, \"Savage Love,\" enrages and excites more than four million people each week.

Yet now our relaxed morals and social mobility have rendered many of the classics untenable. Why shouldn't Maisie know what she knows? It will all e out in family therapy anyway. The vogue for historical novels depends in part on our pleasure in reentering a world of subtle cues and repressed emotion, a time in which a young woman could destroy her life by saying yes to the wrong man. After all, there was no reliable birth control, no divorce, no chance of an independent life or a scandal-free separation. Christina Schwarz's suspenseful debut pivots on two of the lost \"virtues\" of the past: silence and stoicism. Drowning Ruthopens in 1919, on the heels of the influenza epidemic that followed the First World War. Although there were telephones and motor cars and dance halls in the small towns of Wisconsin in those years, the townspeople remained rigid and forbidding. As a young woman, Amanda Starkey, a Lutheran farmer's daughter, had been firmly discouraged from an inappropriate marriage with a neighboring Catholic boy. A few years later, as a nurse in Milwaukee, she is seduced by a dishonorable man. Her shame sends her into a nervous breakdown, and she returns to the family farm. Within a year, though, her beloved sister Mathilde drowns under mysterious circumstances. And when Mathilde's husband, Carl, returns from the war, he finds his small daughter, Ruth, in Amanda's tenacious grip, and she will tell him nothing about the night his wife drowned. Amanda's parents, too, are long gone. \"I killed my parents. Had I mentioned that?\" muses Amanda. \nI killed them because I felt a little fatigued and suffered from a slight, persistent cough. Thinking I was overworked and hadn't been getting enough sleep, I went home for a short visit, just a few days to relax in the country while the sweet corn and the raspberries were ripe. From the city I brought fancy ribbon, two boxes of Ambrosia chocolate, and a deadly gift... I gave the influenza to my mother, who gave it to my father, or maybe it was the other way around. Schwarz is a skillful writer, weaving her grim tale across several decades, always returning to the fateful night of Mathilde's death. Drowning Ruthdisplays her gift for pacing and her harsh insistence on the right ending, rather than the cheery one. --Regina Marler","Alina knows she is not real - the fae queen spun an evil web to create her - but she wants more than to spend her days feeding off humans' energy to survive.

Misremembered as the 'Nine Days Queen', she has been mythologized as a child-woman destroyed on the altar of political expediency. Behind the legend, however, was an opinionated and often rebellious adolescent who died a passionate leader, not merely a victim. Growing up in Jane's shadow, her sisters Katherine and Mary would have to tread carefully to survive.\nThe dramatic lives of the younger Grey sisters remain little known, but under English law they were the heirs - and rivals - to the Tudor monarchs Mary and Elizabeth I. The beautiful Katherine ignored Jane's dying request that she remain faithful to her beliefs, changing her religion to retain Queen Mary's favour only to then risk life and freedom in a secret marriage that threatened Queen Elizabeth's throne.\nWhile Elizabeth's closest adviser fought to save Katherine, her younger sister Mary remained at court as the queen's Maid of Honour. Too plain to be considered significant, it seemed that Lady Mary Grey, at least, would escape the burden of her royal blood. But then she too fell in love, and incurred the queen's fury.\nExploding the many myths of Lady Jane's life and casting fresh light onto Elizabeth's reign, acclaimed historian Leanda de Lisle brings the tumultuous world of the Grey sisters to life, at a time when a royal marriage could gain you a kingdom or cost you everything.","Blurb: Writer Liv Corrigan has the worst luck with men -- her telepathy tends to make them run for the hills.

When Gordon went to her house to speak to her again she met him at her door smelling like soap, shampoo and oh so lovely sex. She closed her eyes to the almost purr of his voice. It was hypnotic and the most soothing thing she'd ever heard in her life. When she found herself pressed against him she looked up into his eyes suddenly very afraid and very needy. \"Don't,\" she said as he lowered his head to hers. \"Please, don't.\" \"Too late.\" He brushed his mouth over hers once then pulled back to look at her again. \"Christ, it's you.\" This time when he took her mouth, it was to devour her.","The adventures of the Girl of Tomorrow continue as Supergirl enters the mind of a Kryptonian monster to stop a killer and goes on a suicide mission to restore sanity within the Department of Extranormal Operations (D.E.O).

It is spring 401 BC, and a vast army of Greek mercenary soldiers travels to Persia to aid the satrap Cyrus in his attempt to overthrow his brother and take the Persian throne. When Cyrus is killed, the expedition turns to disaster. Stranded in enemy territory, betrayed by its Persian allies, the army is in mortal danger, until its manders, including the Athenian Xenophon, take charge and lead the men on a perilous retreat. This is Xenophon's eyewitness account of those events.\nThe march of the Ten Thousand was one of the most famous and gruelling military journeys in all history. The foot-soldiers travelled 1,500 miles across enemy terrain, through present-day Iraq, Syria and Turkey, towards the shores of the Black Sea. They faced terrible hunger, six-foot snowdrifts, attacks from the Persian military and from local inhabitants, and the threat of mutiny and division. Yet this ragged army was a democracy on the move. Rallied by the brilliant Xenophon, the soldiers elected officers, debated strategy and resolved disputes through arbitration. Their fortitude was finally rewarded by the sight of the coast, which they greeted with the triumphant, and now famous cry, 'The sea, the sea!'\nThe Persian Expedition is one of the best surviving portraits both of the Persian Empire, antiquity's first genuine superpower, and of the ancient Greek character in all its valour and plexity. It has thrilled the imagination for centuries, and inspired countless manders from Julius Caesar to the Duke of Wellington. Eunapius of Sardis wrote that 'Alexander would never have bee \"great\" without Xenophon'. In the classic translation by Rex Warner, it remains an enthralling account of an epic adventure. Our specially missioned preface by acclaimed historian Theodore K. Rabb reveals why writers and historians alike 'still look to Xenophon as a master of his craft'.\n[Source: ://.foliosociety./book/PEX/...]","Inspired by true events...\nThe first day of college gives every girl a chance to reinvent herself.\nI go and screw mine up by meeting the most gorgeous guy I've seen in five years while talking to my cat.\nBut Andrew Crowner is far from judgmental.

The four captivating Russian Grand Duchesses--Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia Romanov--were much admired for their happy dispositions, their looks, the clothes they wore and their privileged lifestyle.\nOver the years, the story of the four Romanov sisters and their tragic end in a basement at Ekaterinburg in 1918 has clouded our view of them, leading to a mass of sentimental and idealized hagiography. With this treasure trove of diaries and letters from the grand duchesses to their friends and family, we learn that they were intelligent, sensitive and perceptive witnesses to the dark turmoil within their immediate family and the ominous approach of the Russian Revolution, the nightmare that would sweep their world away, and them along with it.\nThe Romanov Sisters sets out to capture the joy as well as the insecurities and poignancy of those young lives against the backdrop of the dying days of late Imperial Russia, World War I and the Russian Revolution.

Yet there's a black hole at the heart of biology. We do not know why plex life is the way it is, or, for that matter, how life first began. In The Vital Question, award-winning author and biochemist Nick Lane radically reframes evolutionary history, putting forward a solution to conundrums that have puzzled generations of scientists.\nFor two and a half billion years, from the very origins of life, single-celled organisms such as bacteria evolved without changing their basic form. Then, on just one occasion in four billion years, they made the jump to plexity. All plex life, from mushrooms to man, shares puzzling features, such as sex, which are unknown in bacteria. How and why did this radical transformation happen?\nThe answer, Lane argues, lies in energy: all life on Earth lives off a voltage with the strength of a lightning bolt. Building on the pillars of evolutionary theory, Lane's hypothesis draws on cutting-edge research into the link between energy and cell biology, in order to deliver a pelling account of evolution from the very origins of life to the emergence of multicellular organisms, while offering deep insights into our own lives and deaths.\nBoth rigorous and enchanting, The Vital Questionprovides a solution to life's vital question: why are we as we are, and indeed, why are we here at all?","Book 3 in a series of Edinburgh-based police procedurals starring DC Scott Cullen which have been pared favourably with Ian Rankin, Mark Billingham, Christopher Brookmyre, Ed McBain, Elmore Leonard and Stuart MacBride.\nDunpender Distillery in East Lothian is steeped in the traditions of whisky-making.

I loafe and invite my soul, I lean and loafe at my ease....observing a spear of summer grass. So begins Leaves of Grass, the first great American poem and indeed, to this day, the greatest and most essentially American poem in all our national literature. The publication of Leaves of Grass in July 1855 was a landmark event in literary history. Ralph Waldo Emerson judged the book \"the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom America has yet contributed.\" Nothing like the volume had ever appeared before. Everything about it--the unusual jacket and title page, the exuberant preface, the twelve free-flowing, untitled poems embracing every realm of experience--was new. The 1855 edition broke new ground in its relaxed style, which prefigured free verse; in its sexual candor; in its images of racial bonding and democratic togetherness; and in the intensity of its affirmation of the sanctity of the physical world. This Anniversary Edition captures the typeface, design and layout of the original edition supervised by Whitman himself. Today's readers get a sense of the \"ur-text\" of Leaves of Grass, the first version of this historic volume, before Whitman made many revisions of both format and style. The volume also boasts an afterword by Whitman authority David Reynolds, in which he discusses the 1855 edition in its social and cultural contexts: its background, its reception, and its contributions to literary history. There is also an appendix containing the early responses to the volume, including Emerson's letter, Whitman's three self-reviews, and the twenty other known reviews published in various newspapers and magazines. This special volume will be a must-have keepsake for fans of Whitman and lovers of American poetry.","When Amy returns to a long-cherished place and reconnects with an old friend, she discovers that her grace and ease with horses does not always carry over into her relationships with people.\nAfter Amy hears of the death of her mentor, she is surprised when his granddaughter, Carey, mysteriously invites her to visit.

This serious adventure tale begins with Helion's infantry platoon fleeing from the German army and warplanes as they advanced through France in the early days of the war. The soldiers chant as they march and run, \"They shall not have me!\" but are quickly captured and sent to hard labor.\nWriting in English in 1943, after his risky escape to freedom in the United States, Helion vividly depicts the sights, sounds, and smells of the camps, and shrewdly sizes up both captors and captured.

Helion's picture of almost two years without his art is a self-portrait of the artist as a man.","Wild Bill and Michael might have thought they made it out of the subterranean vampire nest unscathed, but in her anger, Silk left Michael a taste of her wrath that's impossible to shake.\nIt's a race against time to cure Michael of a bizarre affliction, and though the hunter and his favorite vamp have few enough friends, Bill can't ash a cigarette without burning another bridge.

The Evolution of Everythingis about bottom-up order and its enemy, the top-down twitch--the endless fascination human beings have for design rather than evolution, for direction rather than emergence.\nDrawing on anecdotes from science, economics, history, politics and philosophy, Matt Ridley's wide-ranging, highly opinionated opus demolishes conventional assumptions that major scientific and social imperatives are dictated by those on high, whether in government, business, academia, or morality. On the contrary, our most important achievements develop from the bottom up. Patterns emerge, trends evolve. Just as skeins of geese form Vs in the sky without meaning to, and termites build mud cathedrals without architects, so brains take shape without brain-makers, learning can happen without teaching and morality changes without a plan. Although we neglect, defy and ignore them, bottom-up trends shape the world. The growth of technology, the sanitation-driven health revolution, the quadrupling of farm yields so that more land can be released for nature--these were largely emergent phenomena, as were the Internet, the mobile phone revolution, and the rise of Asia. Ridley demolishes the arguments for design and effectively makes the case for evolution in the universe, morality, genes, the economy, culture, technology, the mind, personality, population, education, history, government, God, money, and the future. As pelling as it is controversial, authoritative as it is ambitious, Ridley's stunning perspective will revolutionize the way we think about our world and how it works.","When a luxurious residence is built on the Jeddah waterfront not far from young Tarek's neighbourhood, Tarek and his friends dream of employment in the palace to escape their world of petty crime and unrelenting cruelty.

Climate change is only the most visible of the modifications we've made--up until this point, inadvertently--to the planet. And our current behavior threatens not only our own future but that of countless other creatures. By paring Earth's story to those of other planets, astrobiologist David Grinspoon shows what a strange and novel development it is for a species to evolve to build machines, and ultimately, global societies with world-shaping influence.\nWithout minimizing the challenges of the next century, Grinspoon suggests that our present moment is not only one of peril, but also great potential, especially when viewed from a 10,000-year perspective. Our species has surmounted the threat of extinction before, thanks to our innate ingenuity and ability to adapt, and there's every reason to believe we can do so again.\nOur challenge now is to awaken to our role as a force of planetary change, and to grow into this task. We must bee graceful planetary engineers, conscious shapers of our environment and caretakers of Earth's biosphere. This is a perspective that begs us to ask not just what future do we want to avoid, but what do we seek to build? What kind of world do we want? Are humans the worst thing or the best thing to ever happen to our planet? Today we stand at a pivotal juncture, and the answer will depend on the choices we make.","What if the Japanese had developed an atomic bomb at the end of World War II? And one was still around?

Intended for 18+ audience","From Publishers Weekly\nCheeky, irreverent and playfully ingenuous, this abbreviated history of democracy is everything one would expect from the writers of Comedy Central's fake news program, which recently (and somewhat scandalously) won the Television Critics Association's award for outstanding news and public affairs series. The book is laid out like a textbook, with \"Discussion Questions\" (\"Why do you think the Framers made the Constitution so soul-crushingly boring?\"), \"Classroom Activities\" (\"Using felt and yarn, make a hand puppet of Clarence Thomas. Ta-da! You're Antonin Scalia!\") and plenty of amusing graphics, including a board game that resembles the game Life but which follows a presidential term: \"Optimistic press release on economy ineffective. Spin again.\" No one evades the authors' scrutiny, not even the Pilgrims, who came to America \"to escape religious persecution... create a society where they could worship as they pleased and one day, God willing, even do some persecuting of their own.\" The media fares the worst, however. An entire chapter is devoted to telling the \"inspirational\" story of how the media \"transformed itself from a mere public necessity into an entertaining profit center for ever-expanding corporate empires.\" But if this and other criticisms  a few unpatriotic feelings, a section describing how worse off the rest of the world is should buoy spirits. From its dedication (\"To the huddled masses--Keep yearnin'!\") to its final chapter, which lampoons the 2004 presidential candidates, this humorous sendup of American politics never fails to entertain, poke fun and provoke thought.\nCopyright (c) Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This collection contains 31 short pieces that are among his personal favorites. Two sections contain his series stories, the ``Black Widower'' and the ``Union Club'' mysteries. Brief introductions to each section and story will serve to acquaint readers with the general background of the series. A third section contains miscellaneous mysteries. All are clear and entertaining. This is a book to be read on ``a little here, a little there'' basis. The stories are short, and prolonged reading results in a series of mental stops and starts that are wearying. Also, the stories are written according to a set formula. However, read on the installment plan, the book is worth the effort. If the recent spate of series in juvenile publishing is any guide, this collection should please adolescents, including reluctant readers.\n- School Library Journal","I'm a professional mourner.

Right from his earliest days to the end of his life, Dahl was intrigued by what doctors do, and why they do it.\nDuring his lifetime, he and his family suffered some terrible medical tragedies: Dahl nearly died when his fighter plane went down in World War II; his son had a severe brain injury in an accident, and his daughter died of measles infection of the brain. But he also had some medical triumphs: he dragged himself back to health after the plane crash, despite a skull fracture, back injuries, and blindness; he was responsible for inventing a medical device (the Wade-Dahl-Till valve) to treat his son's hydrocephalus (water on the brain), and he taught his first wife Patricia to talk again after a devastating stroke. His medical interactions clearly influenced some of his writing - for example, the explosive potions in George's Marvellous Medicine. And sometimes his writing impacted on events in his life - for example, the research on neuroanatomy he did for his short story William and Mary later helped him design the valve for treating hydrocephalus.\nIn this unique book, Professor Tom Solomon, who looked after Dahl towards the end of his life, examines Dahl's fascination with medicine.","The \"fascinating\" (The New Yorker) story of Athanasius Kircher, the eccentric scholar-inventor who was either a great genius or a crackpot... or a bit of both.\nThe interests of Athanasius Kircher, the legendary seventeenth-century priest-scientist, knew no bounds.

A Man of Misconceptions traces the rise, success, and eventual fall of this fascinating character as he attempted to e to terms with a changing world.\nWith humor and insight, John Glassie returns Kircher to his rightful place as one of history's most unforgettable figures.\nA Scientific AmericanBest Science Book of 2012\nAn Atlantic Wire Best Book of 2012\nA New York Times Book Review\"Editor's Choice\"","A poignant and unforgettable tale of love, loss, and moving on . . . with the help of one not-so-little dog\nRocky's husband Bob was just forty-two when she discovered him lying cold and lifeless on the bathroom floor . . . and Rocky's world changed forever.

Why are they not mating? What scent have they caught on the wind? Why do these wolves seem... different?\nIt won't be long before they discover the terrible truth...\nExcerpt:\nThe howl turned to a yell, cracking halfway as the vocal cords shifted, and the alpha came, his screams echoing around the clearing. As soon as he'd filled Emily with his seed he fell to the side, sliding out of her ravaged pussy to collapse beside her. Aylen stared in shock. He was human, it was undeniable. The fur remained across the chest and back, thinner but still coarse, and the hair on his head was a long, greasy mane, but apart from that he looked entirely human.\nHowls erupted from the edge of the clearing, and in the darkness Aylen could make out the shifting shapes of the other wolves. They began to prowl from the darkness into the moonlight, both men and women, all of them muscular and powerful. They walked like... well, like wolves. Aylen knew each of them intimately, and she thought she could identify them by the way they moved around the clearing.\nOne woman, tall and rangy with dark, dirty hair and a pert, luscious ass prowled around the center, her eyes never leaving Emily and the alpha. She was the alpha female, Aylen realized, and she'd been cheated from her prize. The alpha male lazily lifted his head and growled a warning, and she backed away a few steps before holding her ground. The male rose to his feet and stood firm, a low growl rumbling from his throat, and then he turned quickly, lifted Emily easily with one hand and threw her over his shoulder. Without another sound he was gone from the clearing, and Emily with him.\nToo late, Aylen understood her problem. When the alpha had fucked Emily he'd made her the new alpha female. The old alpha had fallen in rank, and Aylen herself... well, she was nothing. Fair game. She hid behind the rock, trying to make herself smaller. The other wolves knew she was there, but maybe they'd be preoccupied with their own kind in the mating frenzy that was beginning. If she stayed silent she may have the chance to creep from the clearing while the wolves were lost in their private bliss. She just had to -\nthe first wolf attacked. The man landed heavily on her back, pushing her down against the rock with his powerful arms, pinning her to the cold stone as he yanked her ski pants down to her knees. She yelled in shock and pain as he forced his way inside her. His cock was enormous, and this time it was already erect. Aylen's nose was filled with the musky scent of his sweat, and she felt his searing breath on the back of her neck as he forced her against the rock. He fucked her feverishly, hard and fast, and it was only moments before she felt the first jet of hot cum spurt into her pussy. She never even saw her attacker. By the time she caught her breath and turned around he'd melted back into the pack.\nAylen shook with fear. She felt hot cum dripping down her inner thighs, and she knew her body was sending out signals that every member of the pack could sense. She tried to back against the rock to block attackers from the rear, but as she turned she saw four men staring at her body. Their sharp yellow eyes bore into her, and their lips gleamed as they snarled with hunger.","Antligen ar den har, den fjarde romanen i Johan Theorins Olandssvit!\nSolen steker den kalkvita on, men semesterparadiset doljer morka hemligheter.\n\"Spokskeppet kom glidande i morkret, over blankande svart vatten, och vajde inte for nagot eller nagon.

He takes us into the secret world of \"Survivor\" Spoilers, where avid internet users pool their knowledge to unearth the show's secrets before they are revealed on the air. He introduces us to young \"Harry Potter\" fans who are writing their own Hogwarts tales while executives at Warner Brothers struggle for control of their franchise. He shows us how \"The Matrix\" has pushed transmedia storytelling to new levels, creating a fictional world where consumers track down bits of the story across multiple media channels.Jenkins argues that struggles over convergence will redefine the face of American popular culture. Industry leaders see opportunities to direct content across many channels to increase revenue and broaden markets. At the same time, consumers envision a liberated public sphere, free of network controls, in a decentralized media environment. Sometimes corporate and grassroots efforts reinforce each other, creating closer, more rewarding relations between media producers and consumers. Sometimes these two forces are at war.\nJenkins provides a riveting introduction to the world where every story gets told and every brand gets sold across multiple media platforms. He explains the cultural shift that is occurring as consumers fight for control across disparate channels, changing the way we do business, elect our leaders, and educate our children.","Where would humanity be without fire, farming, or wine?

Is Paris Burning? reconstructs the network of fateful events that heralded one of the most dramatic episodes of our time. \"Is Paris burning\" screams the shrill voice of Adolf Hitler. At that moment, noon on August 25, 1944, advance elements of General Leclerc's Free French, supported by American infantry, were streaming across the bridges of the Seine. Their arrival was the climax of an extraordinary and fateful interplay of circumstances that saved the city, its population and its priceless treasures from Hitler's vengeful sentence of destruction and death. Few days in history have witnessed an emotional outpouring as overwhelming as that which acpanied the liberation of Paris.

Is Paris Burning? is the product of nearly 3 years of research, during which the authors studied hundreds of documents, transcripts of Resistance radio messages, 20-yr. old cables, microfilms of German military records seized after the war, the official archives of SHAEF, and the files of secret correspondence between de Gaulle, Churchill, Roosevelt, and Eisenhower. Is Paris Burning? interweaves the personal experiences of those who were in the forefront of the melee and those who were behind the scenes and brings vividly to life the impassioned days when Paris struggled for her life.","The third book in the \"funny, sexy, and lively\" (Publishers Weekly) romance series about a paranormal dating service called Midnight Liaisons.\nFrom the supernatural dating capital of the world, it's the Midnight Liaisons Dating Game!\nLet's meet our eligible bachelors . . .\n\"Cold hands, warm heart\" applies to Bachelor #1.

Brought to the attention of the director Trevor Nunn by the actress Vanessa Redgrave (who has contributed a Foreword to this edition), \"this early work...changed our perception of a major writer and still packs a hefty political punch\" (London Independent). Written in 1938 and based on an actual newspaper story, the play follows the events of a prison atrocity which shocked the nation: convicts leading a hunger strike in a Pennsylvania prison were locked in a steam-heated cell and roasted to death. Williams later said: \"I have never written anything since that could pete with it in violence and horror.\" Its sympathetic treatment of black and homosexual characters may have kept the play unproduced in its own time. But its flashes of lyricism and pelling dialogue presage the great plays Williams has yet to write. Not About Nightingalesshows us the young playwright (for the first time using his signature \"Tennessee\") as a political writer, passionate about social injustice, and reflecting the plight of outcasts in Depression America. The stylistic influences of European Expressionism, radical American theatre of the 1930s, and popular film make it unique among the group of four early plays. Not About Nightingaleshas been edited by eminent Williams scholar Allean Hale, who has also provided an illuminating historical introduction.","A different kind of Frankenstein.\nEinna is a lot like other teenage girls, naive, idealistic, secretive, disobedient and interested in boys.

Under Edward Heath, the optimism of the Sixties had bee a distant memory. Now the headlines were dominated by strikes and blackouts, unemployment and inflation.

The best how-to manual ever published.\" -- Kevin Kelly, Cool Tools\nScott McCloud tore down the wall between high and low culture in 1993 with Understanding Comics, a massive ic book about ics, linking the medium to such diverse fields as media theory, movie criticism, and web design. In Reinventing Comics, McCloud took this to the next level, charting twelve different revolutions in how ics are generated, read, and perceived today. Now, in Making Comics, McCloud focuses his analysis on the art form itself, exploring the creation of ics, from the broadest principles to the sharpest details (like how to accentuate a character's facial muscles in order to form the emotion of disgust rather than the emotion of surprise.) And he does all of it in his inimitable voice and through his cartoon stand-in narrator, mixing dry humor and legitimate instruction. McCloud shows his reader how to master the human condition through word and image in a brilliantly minimalistic way. Both ic book devotees and the uninitiated will marvel at this journey into a once-underappreciated art form.","As soon as I saw him, I knew there was just one word to describe him: BIG... \nDr. Vanessa Gilmore is new in town.

She watched drug panies stray from their original mission of discovering and manufacturing useful drugs and instead bee vast marketing machines with unprecedented control over their own fortunes. She saw them gain nearly limitless influence over medical research, education, and how doctors do their jobs. She sympathized as the American public, particularly the elderly, struggled and incregly failed to meet spiraling prescription drug prices. Now, in this bold, hard-hitting new book, Dr. Angell exposes the shocking truth of what the pharmaceutical industry has bee-and argues for essential, long-overdue change.\nCurrently Americans spend a staggering $200 billion each year on prescription drugs. As Dr. Angell powerfully demonstrates, claims that high drug prices are necessary to fund research and development are unfounded: The truth is that drug panies funnel the bulk of their resources into the marketing of products of dubious benefit. Meanwhile, as profits soar, the panies brazenly use their wealth and power to push their agenda through Congress, the FDA, and academic medical centers.\nZeroing in on hugely successful drugs like AZT (the first drug to treat HIV/AIDS), Taxol (the best-selling cancer drug in history), and the blockbuster allergy drug Claritin, Dr. Angell demonstrates exactly how new products are brought to market. Drug panies, she shows, routinely rely on publicly funded institutions for their basic research; they rig clinical trials to make their products look better than they are; and they use their legions of lawyers to stretch out government-granted exclusive marketing rights for years. They also flood the market with copycat drugs that cost a lot more than the drugs they mimic but are no more effective.\nThe American pharmaceutical industry needs to be saved, mainly from itself, and Dr. Angell proposes a program of vital reforms, which includes restoring impartiality to clinical research and severing the ties between drug panies and medical education. Written with fierce passion and substantiated with in-depth research, The Truth About the Drug Companiesis a searing indictment of an industry that has spun out of control.","You always hear about the moment right before the end when you see your life flash before your eyes.

In Consciousness and the Social Brain, Princeton neuroscientist Michael Graziano lays out an audacious new theory to account for the deepest mystery of them all. The human brain has evolved a plex circuitry that allows it to be socially intelligent. This social machinery has only just begun to be studied in detail. One function of this circuitry is to attribute awareness to others: to pute that person Y is aware of thing X. In Graziano's theory, the machinery that attributes awareness to others also attributes it to oneself. Damage that machinery and you disrupt your own awareness. Graziano discusses the science, the evidence, the philosophy, and the surprising implications of this new theory.","Sometimes the ghosts that haunt us most aren't the dead.\nIt has been nearly a year since writer Thomas Witt lost his daughter in a horrible car accident which nearly killed him.

The Immortals is different. This stunning first novel full of emotion addresses the truth of the female predicament -- the unsung heroes who are left behind on the homefront of war. We experience the love and challenges between husband and wife, we feel the closeness of mother and daughter, and we bond with the most unlikely of women. When we first meet Calli Coleman, a classically trained musician from a well-connected Baltimore family, it is the summer of 2005 and the United States has been at war in Iraq for two years. She has been uprooted from the hometown she adores and abruptly lands in the role of Army wife in provincial Sackets Harbor, New York outside of Fort Drum. Naive to all things military, Calli has no idea what's in store for her when Luke's infantry unit deploys to the Iraq War to an area CNN dubs \"The Triangle of Death\". Left back in New York with their three-year-old daughter Audrey, black Labrador Satchmo, and a fat cat named Charlemagne, Calli has a steep learning curve as she tumbles into a plicated social hierarchy where she finds her well-heeled childhood does her more harm than good. Desperately missing her friends and family and amid the impertinent Army wives, unlikely friendships evolve with Josie, Rachel, and Daphne. Seemingly as different from one another as can be, and certainly unlike her dynamic, jet-setting best friend Eula, these women will nonetheless e together for courage, support, and to embark upon the deeply emotional roller coaster ride of being an Army wife.\nWith only letters and email as their munication, Calli knows very little about Luke's mission in Iraq. Through their letters we get a beautiful picture of their love for each other and what it means to serve our Nation but Luke cannot share much about the confidential assignment. The news on the radio and television is never good. Calli dreads the phone ringing to tell her of more soldiers being blown up by IEDs or killed by gunfire and she fears \"The Trifecta\" - the casualty assistance officer, rear-detachment office, and chaplain - will be sitting in her driveway waiting to tell her the worst news she can imagine. In Luke's absence, Calli, alone with her daughter, learns that if anything is worth fighting for, it's the unpredictable new friendships that will sustain her through loneliness and the ever-present specter of widowhood. At the end Calli will find herself on an unexpected course full of epiphanies about herself and her marriage.\nThe Immortals is an emotional examination of marriage, friendship, war, and death. Tori Eversmann, through her distinctive voice that es from her own time as an Army wife, has given us an unforgettable story.","Alternate Cover Edition of ASIN B00H2WPGDA\nWhen puberty brings on her first Shift, Missy goes into the mountains for two years until finally learning to Change back.

This is the question that Gohar Homayounpour poses to herself, and to us, at the beginning of this memoir of displacement, nostalgia, love, and pain. Twenty years after leaving her country, Homayounpour, an Iranian, Western-trained psychoanalyst, returns to Tehran to establish a psychoanalytic practice. When an American colleague exclaims, \"I do not think that Iranians can free-associate!\" Homayounpour responds that in her opinion Iranians do nothing but. Iranian culture, she says, revolves around stories. Why wouldn't Freud's methods work, given Iranians' need to talk?\nThus begins a fascinating narrative of interlocking stories that resembles--more than a little--a psychoanalytic session. Homayounpour recounts the pleasure and pain of returning to her motherland, her passion for the work of Milan Kundera, her plex relationship with Kundera's Iranian translator (her father), and her own and other Iranians' anxieties of influence and disobedience. Woven throughout the narrative are glimpses of her sometimes frustrating, always candid, sessions with patients. Ms. N, a famous artist, dreams of abandonment and sits in the analyst's chair rather than on the analysand's couch; a young chador-clad woman expresses shame because she has lost her virginity; an eloquently suicidal young man cannot kill himself.\nAs a psychoanalyst, Homayounpour knows that behind every story told is another story that remains untold. Doing Psychoanalysis in Tehran connects the stories, spoken and unspoken, that ordinary Iranians tell about their lives before their hour is up.\nAbout the Author\nGohar Homayounpour is a practicing psychoanalyst in Tehran. She trains and supervises the psychoanalysts of the Freudian Group of Tehran and is Professor of Psychology at Shahid Besheti University Tehran.","Slaying beauty\nShe was tall, blonde, and offering Garrett a fee that was irresistible to take a case that seemed open and shut.

Unfortunately, the authors' pioneering work on the effects of LSD on the human psyche, which was viewed by its participants as possibly heralding a revolution in the study of the mind, was among the casualties of this interdiction. As a result, the promising results to which their studies attested were never fully explored. Nevertheless, their 15 years of research represents a sober and authoritative appraisal of what remains one of the most controversial developments in the study of the human psyche. Avoiding the wild excesses taken by both sides on this issue,  is unique for the light it sheds on the possibilities and the limitations of psychedelic drugs, as well as on the techniques for working with them. With drug legalization an incregly important issue, The Varieties of Psychedelic Experienceprovides a wele and much needed contrast to the current hysteria that surrounds this topic.","While Modo has spent a quiet winter recovering from hisadventure in the dark deeps, talk of ancient Egyptianruins in the midst of the Australian rainforest has been swirlingaround London.

For his decorated bravery, and also his harmful recklessness, he is soon sent to the Fourth Army School for officer training, then dispatched to Morlancourt, a raid, and on through the Somme. After being wounded by a bullet through the lung, he returns home to convalesce, where his questioning of the war and the British Military establishment leads him to write a public anti-war letter (verbatim the letter Sassoon wrote in 1917, entitled \"Finished with the War: A Soldier's Declaration\", which was eventually read in the British House of Commons). Through the help of close friend David Cromlech (based on Sassoon's friend Robert Graves) a medical board decides not to prosecute, but instead deem him to be mentally ill, suffering from shell-shock, and sends him to a hospital for treatment. Sassoon's stunning portrayal of a mind ing to terms with the brutal truths he has encountered in war--as well as his unsentimental, though often poetic, portrayal of class-defined life in England at wartime--is amongst the greatest books ever written about World War I, or war itself.\nFor more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Today the debate over who Jesus is rages on. Has the Bible bound Christians to a narrow and mistaken notion of Jesus? Should we listen to other gospels, other sayings of Jesus, that enlarge and correct a mistaken story?

Hopefully it isn't too late...","On a sunny fall afternoon in 1988, Jon Sarkin was playing golf when, without a whisper of warning, his life changed forever. As he bent down to pick up his golf ball, something strange and massive happened inside his head; part of his brain seemed to unhinge, to split apart and float away. For an utterly inexplicable reason, a tiny blood vessel, thin as a thread, deep inside the folds of his gray matter had suddenly shifted ever so slightly, rubbing up against his acoustic nerve. Any noise now caused him excruciating pain.\nAfter months of seeking treatment to no avail, in desperation Sarkin resorted to radical deep-brain surgery, which seemed to go well until during recovery his brain began to bleed and he suffered a major stroke. When he awoke, he was a different man. Before the stroke, he was a calm, disciplined chiropractor, a happily married husband and father of a newborn son. Now he was transformed into a volatile and wildly exuberant obsessive, seized by a manic desire to create art, devoting virtually all his waking hours to furiously drawing, painting, and writing poems and letters to himself, strangely detached from his wife and child, and unable to return to his normal working life. His sense of self had been shattered, his intellect intact but his way of being drastically altered. His art became a relentless quest for the right words and pictures to unlock the secrets of how to live this strange new life. And what was even stranger was that he remembered his former self.\nIn a beautifully crafted narrative, award-winning journalist and Pulitzer Prize finalist Amy Ellis Nutt interweaves Sarkin's remarkable story with a fascinating tour of the history of and latest findings in neuroscience and evolution that illuminate how the brain produces, from its web of billions of neurons and chaos of liquid electrical pulses, the richness of human experience that makes us who we are. Nutt brings vividly to life pivotal moments of discovery in neuroscience, from the shocking \"rebirth\" of a young girl hanged in 1650 to the first autopsy of an autistic savant's brain, and the extraordinary true stories of people whose personalities and cognitive abilities were dramatically altered by brain trauma, often in shocking ways.\nProbing recent revelations about the workings of creativity in the brain and the role of art in the evolution of human intelligence, she reveals how Jon Sarkin's obsessive need to create mirrors the earliest function of art in the brain. Introducing major findings about how our sense of self transcends the bounds of our own bodies, she explores how it is that the brain generates an individual \"self\" and how, if damage to our brains can so alter who we are, we can nonetheless be said to have a soul.\nFor Jon Sarkin, with his personality and sense of self permanently altered, making art became his bridge back to life, a means of reassembling from the shards of his former self a new man who could rejoin his family and fashion a viable life. He is now an acclaimed artist who exhibits at some of the country's most prestigious venues, as well as a devoted husband to his wife, Kim, and father to their three children. At once wrenching and inspiring, this is a story of the remarkable human capacity to overe the most daunting obstacles and of the extraordinary workings of the human mind.","Three sisters are growing up in 1920s Bermondsey - the larder of London - with its bustling docks, its spice mill, tannery and factories. \nSouthwells jam factory is where many of the girls work.\nAnd Milly Colman knows she's lucky.

And during those four decades, his wide knowledge, keen judgment, prodigious energy, and sharp sense of humor have made him America's most celebrated film critic. He was the first such critic to win a Pulitzer Prize--one of just three film critics ever to receive that honor--and the only one to have a star dedicated to him on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. His groundbreaking hit TV show, At the Movies, meanwhile, has made \"two thumbs up\" one of the most coveted hallmarks in the entire industry.\nNo critic alive has reviewed more movies than Roger Ebert, and yet his essential writings have never been collected in a single volume--until now. With Awake in the Dark, both fans and film buffs can finally bask in the best of Ebert's work. The reviews, interviews, and essays collected here present a picture of this indispensable critic's numerous contributions to the cinema and cinephilia. From The Godfatherto GoodFellas, from Cries and Whispersto Crash, the reviews in Awake in the Darkspan some of the most exceptional periods in film history, from the dramatic rise of rebel Hollywood and the heyday of the auteur, to the triumph of blockbuster films such as Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark, to the indie revolution that is still with us today.\nThe extraordinary interviews gathered in Awake in the Darkcapture Ebert engaging not only some of the most influential directors of our time--Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Woody Allen, Robert Altman, Werner Herzog, and Ingmar Bergman--but also some of the silver screen's most respected and dynamic personalities, including actors as diverse as Robert Mitchum, James Stewart, Warren Beatty, and Meryl Streep. Ebert's remarkable essays play a significant part in Awake in the Darkas well. The book contains some of Ebert's most admired pieces, among them a moving appreciation of John Cassavetes and a loving tribute to the virtues of black-and-white films.\nIf Pauline Kael and Andrew Sarris were godmother and godfather to the movie generation, then Ebert is its voice from within--a writer whose exceptional intelligence and daily bursts of insight and enthusiasm have shaped the way we think about the movies. Awake in the Dark, therefore, will be a treasure trove not just for fans of this seminal critic, but for anyone desiring a fascinating and pulsively readable chronicle of film since the late 1960s.","Three days before he's due to tie the knot with Priscilla Livengood, eligible bachelor Cornelious Weaver suffers a massive heart attack-in another woman's bed.

He mitted suicide in 2013 after being indicted by the government for illegally downloading millions of academic articles from a nonprofit online database. From the age of fifteen, when Swartz, a puter prodigy, worked with Lawrence Lessig to launch Creative Commons, to his years as a fighter for copyright reform and open information, to his work leading the protests against the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), to his posthumous status as a cultural icon, Swartz's life was inextricably connected to the free culture movement.

In the process, the book explores the history of copyright statutes and the public domain; examines archivists' ongoing quest to build the \"library of the future\"; and charts the rise of open access, copyleft, and other ideologies that have e to challenge protectionist IP policies. Peters also breaks down the government's case against Swartz and explains how we reached the point where federally funded academic research came to be considered private property, and downloading that material in bulk came to be considered a federal crime.\nThe Idealistis an important investigation of the fate of the digital mons in an incregly corporatized Internet, and an essential look at the impact of the free culture movement on our daily lives and on generations to e.","They say when the demons e, you either fight or you die.\nThe Black Dogs know this all too well.

When Leo's scheme finally collapsed in 1923, he vanished, and the Chicago state's attorney, a man whose lust for power equaled Leo's own lust for money, began an international manhunt that lasted almost a year.

Levine wondered, What if the little guy could see all trades in real time and, in the process, cut out the middlemen who picked his pocket with every trade?

The giant institutions and the little guys had developed a shared interest, and they were both imperiled.

The seventeen-syllable form is rooted in a Japanese tradition of close observation of nature, of making poetry from subtle suggestion. Infused by its great practitioners with the spirit of Zen Buddhism, the haiku has served as an example of the power of direct observation to the first generation of American modernist poets like Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams and also as an example of spontaneity and Zen alertness to the new poets of the 1950's.\nThis definite collection brings together in fresh translations by an American poet the essential poems of the three greatest masters: Matsuo Basho in the seventeenth century; Yosa Buson in the eighteenth century; and Kobayashi Issa in the early nineteenth century. Robert Haas has written a lively and informed introduction, provided brief examples by each poet of their work in the halibun, or poetic prose form, and included informal notes to the poems. This is a useful and inspiring addition to The Essential Poets series.","A Prisoner of His Past\nGabriel Ridgley, the Marquess of Tremont, is dubbed The Angel for his pristine reputation.

For years, used copies have been making the rounds, manding a premium auction price & making a profit for used book dealers. Now, you can not only get your own fresh, updated version, you can get it as an ebook. Given its theme, the metamorphosis seems particularly ironic.\nFor two years, Pete Garey wandered through the strange new world of Earth after the Change, a moment when technology ceased to work & things like planes, trains & automobiles became junk. He was alone until the day he was found by a unicorn who'd bee his familiar. Ariel is just one of the many magical creatures to appear after the Change, but the only one with the stunning ability (or, perhaps, desire) to talk. The bond between Pete & Ariel will be like no other he's experienced.\nIf you know mythology, you know what anyone who wishes to be close to a unicorn must be. Pete's a virgin of 20. In many ways he's more unworldly than expected. Whether the loss of the technical wonders of modernity has contributed to his naivete, or if it is the result of so many years in a depopulated country, is difficult to say. Could be he would have grown up that way even in the before-Change world. Whatever the reason, it makes him perfectly suited to be Ariel's friend & foil.\nAriel is pure--she's a unicorn, after all--but no pushover. Like Pete, she has steel to balance her softness. At times, the struggle between the good & bad inside each of them is as great a threat as the unmitigated evil they join to defeat. Isn't that the conflict at the heart of all good literature? In Ariel, readers have many dark/light things to consider, including deciding for themselves whether the world is a better or worse place after the Change. The answer is as ambiguous as most real life decisions. Boyett isn't going to do your thinking for you.\nMaybe that's the lasting appeal of Ariel. Little is clear cut in this fantasy. Not the motives of the characters. Not the true nature of the mythical beasts that emerge. Not even the why of everything that happened. Such unanswered questions are among the many reasons your thoughts will turn again & again to , re-examining these unknowns.--Lisa DuMond (edited)","An Inconvenient Truth--Gore's groundbreaking, battle cry of a follow-up to the bestselling Earth in the Balance--is being published to tie in with a documentary film of the same name.

This book explains why the search for intelligent life beyond Earth ought be expanded & how it can be done. 50 years ago, astronomer Frank Drake 1st pointed a radio telescope at nearby stars, hoping for a signal from an alien civilization. Thus began one of the boldest scientific projects, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. After a half-century of scanning astronomers have little to report but an eerie silence-eerie because many believe the cosmos teems with life.

From a fortress-like former bank building, American Pain's doctors distributed massive quantities of oxycodone to hundreds of customers a day, mostly traffickers and addicts who came by the vanload. Inked muscle-heads ran the clinic's security. Former strippers operated the pharmacy, counting out pills and stashing cash in garbage bags. Under their lab coats, the doctors carried guns and it was all legal sort of. American Pain was the brainchild of Chris George, a 27-year-old convicted drug felon. The son of a South Florida home builder, Chris George grew up in ultra-rich Wellington, where Bill Gates, Springsteen, and Madonna kept houses. Thick-necked from weightlifting, he and his twin brother hung out with mobsters, invested in strip clubs, brawled with cops, and grinned for their mug shots. After the housing market stalled, a local doctor clued in the brothers to the burgeoning underground market for lightly regulated prescription painkillers. In Florida, pain clinics could dispense the meds, and no one tracked the patients. Seizing the opportunity, Chris George teamed up with the doctor, and word got out. Just two years later Chris had raked in $40 million, and 90 percent of the pills his doctors prescribed flowed north to feed the rest of the country's insatiable narcotics addiction. Meanwhile, hundreds more pain clinics in the mold of American Pain had popped up in the Sunshine State, creating a gigantic new drug industry. American Pain chronicles the rise and fall of this game-changing pill mill, and how it helped tip the nation into its current opioid crisis, the deadliest drug epidemic in American history. The narrative swings back and forth between Florida and Kentucky, and is populated by a gaudy and diverse cast of characters. This includes the incongruous band of wealthy bad boys, thugs and esteemed physicians who built American Pain, as well as penniless Kentucky clans who transformed themselves into painkiller trafficking rings. It includes addicts whose lives were devastated by American Pain's drugs, and the federal agents and grieving mothers who labored for years to bring the clinic's crew to justice.\"","What if you were thrown into a foreign society, never to see home again?

Using the Bard's own immortal list of a man's seven ages in As You Like It, Bate deduces the crucial events of Shakespeare's life and connects them to his world and work as never before.\nHere is the author as an infant, born into a world of plague and syphillis, diseases with which he became closely familiar; as a schoolboy, a position he portrayed in The Merry Wives of Windsor, in which a clever, cheeky lad named William learns Latin grammar; as a lover, married at eighteen to an older woman already pregnant, perhaps presaging Bassanio, who in The Merchant of Venice won a wife who could save him from financial ruin. Here, too, is Shakespeare as a soldier, writing Henry the Fifth's St. Crispin's Day speech, with a nod to his own monarch Elizabeth I's passionate addresses; as a justice, revealing his possible legal training in his precise use of the law in plays from Hamletto Macbeth; and as a pantaloon, an early retiree because of, Bate postulates, either illness or a scandal. Finally, Shakespeare enters oblivion, with sonnets that suggest he actively sought immortality through his art and secretly helped shape his posthumous image more than anyone ever knew.\nEqual parts masterly detective story, brilliant literary analysis, and insightful world history, Soul of the Ageis more than a superb new recounting of Shakespeare's experiences; it is a bold and entertaining work of scholarship and speculation, one that shifts from past to present, reality to the imagination, to reveal how this unsurpassed artist came to be.","Sundays In Manila: Professor Robert Boyer provides us with a traveler's view of the Philippines as he chronicles his travels to the country.

The effect of his diatribe is doubly shocking, leaving not only his distinguished audience gasping but also many people tuning in to the BBC's live radio broadcast. But as he approaches the end of his assault, the speech suddenly dissolves into incoherence when he stumbles over a name--a name he normally takes such pains to avoid--that takes him back 40 years to a special time and a special place. \"Summer in February\" is a disturbing and moving re-creation of a celebrated Edwardian artistic munity enjoying the last days of a golden age soon to be shattered by war. It is a resonant, understated love story of beauty, deprivation, and tragedy.","The Mobdidn't take \"no\" for an answer, so when \"Bugsy\" Siegel and Moe Sedway grabbed a hold of a few co bosses and told 'em they were now partners in their Las Vegas cos, the old bosses glumly agreed. Within five years Las Vegas was the Mob's greatest venture and most spectacular success, and through 40 years of frenzy, murder, deceit, scams, and skimming, the FBI listened on phone taps and did virtually nothing to stop the fun. This book brings out the truth about the Mob's control of the cos in Vegas like you've never heard it before, from start to finish.\nEarly on, two of the nation's most powerful, dirty, and murderous crime family bosses went to prison in the 1930's: Al Capone, and Lucky Luciano. Frank Nitti took over the Chicago Outfit, while Frank Costello ran things for the Luciano Family. Both men were influenced by their bosses from prison, and both sent enough gangsters into the streets to influence loan sharking, extortion, union control, and drug sales.\nBugsy Siegel worked for both groups, handling a string of murders and opening up gaming on the west coast, and that included Las Vegas, an oasis of sin in the middle of the desert - and it was legal. Most of it. The FBI watched as the Mob took control of co after co, killed off the petition, and stole enough money to bribe their way to respectability back home.\nBy the 1950's, nearly every major crime family had a stake in a Las Vegas co. Some did better than others. Co owners watched-over their profits while peting crime families eyed each other's success like jealous lovers. Murder often followed.","From the author of The Tenth Giftes another story of exotic, foreign lands, entwining storylines spanning generations, and the quests to overe love lost.\n\"My dear Isabelle, in the attic you will find a box with your name on it.\"\nIsabelle's estranged archeologist father dies, leaving her a puzzle.

In 'The Hope', his long-awaited return to historical fiction, he turns to one of the most thrilling stories of our time - the saga of Israel. In the grand, epic style of 'The Winds of War' and 'War and Remembrance',\n'The Hope' plunges the reader into the major battles, the disasters and victories, and the fragile periods of peace from the 1948 War of Independence to the astounding triumph of the Six-Day War in 1967. And since Israelis have seen their share of ic mishaps as well as heroism, this novel offers some of Herman Wouk's most amusing scenes since the famed \"strawberry business\" in 'The Caine Mutiny'.\nFirst to last 'The Hope' is a tale of four Israeli army officers and the women they love: Zev Barak, Viennese-born cultured military man; Benny Luria, ace fighter pilot with religious stirrings; Sam Pasternak, sardonic and mysterious Mossad man; and an antic dashing warrior they call Kishote, Hebrew for Quixote, who arrives at Israel's first pitched battle a refugee boy on a mule and over the years rises to high rank.\nIn the love stories of these four men, the author of 'Marjorie Morningstar' has created a gallery of three memorable Israeli women and one quirky fascinating American, daughter of a high CIA official and headmistress of a Washington girls school. With the authenticity, authority, and narrative force of Wouk's finest fiction, The Hope portrays not so much the victory of one people over another, as the gallantry of the human spirit, surviving and triumphing against crushing odds. In that sense it can be called a tale of hope for all mankind; a note that Herman Wouk has struck in all his writings, against the prevailing pessimism of our turbulent century.","'How Music Works' is David Byrne's remarkable and buoyant celebration of a subject he has spent a lifetime thinking about. In it he explores how profoundly music is shaped by its time and place, and he explains how the advent of recording technology in the twentieth century forever changed our relationship to playing, performing, and listening to music.\nActing as historian and anthropologist, raconteur and social scientist, he searches for patterns--and shows how those patterns have affected his own work over the years with Talking Heads and his many collaborators, from Brian Eno to Caetano Veloso. Byrne sees music as part of a larger, almost Darwinian pattern of adaptations and responses to its cultural and physical context. His range is panoptic, taking us from Wagnerian opera houses to African villages, from his earliest high school reel-to-reel recordings to his latest work in a home music studio (and all the big studios in between).\nTouching on the joy, the physics, and even the business of making music, 'How Music Works' is a brainy, irresistible adventure and an impassioned argument about music's liberating, life-affirming power.","On the Delta shuttle between New York and Washington, Rachel finds herself sitting next to Donald - six foot six, with dark wavy hair, a big easy smile.

Since their first appearance in 1963, they have simultaneously fascinated and terrified generations of children, their instant success ensuring, and sometimes eclipsing, that of Doctor Who. They sprang from the imagination of Terry Nation, a failed stand-up ic who became one of the most prolific writers for television that Britian ever produced. Survivors, his vision of a post-apocalyptic England, so haunted audiences in the Seventies that the BBC revived it over thirty years on, and Blake's 7, constantly rumored for return, endures as a cult sci-fi classic. But it is for his genocidal pepperpots that Nation is most often remembered, and on the 50th anniversary of their creation they continue to top the Saturday-night ratings. Yet while the Daleks brought him notoriety and riches, Nation played a much wider role in British broadcasting's golden age. He wrote for Spike Milligan, Frankie Howerd and an incregly troubled Tony Hancock, and as one of the key figures behind the adventure series of the Sixties - including The Avengers, The Saint and The Persuaders! - he turned the pulp classics of his boyhood into a major British export. In The Man Who Invented the Daleks, acclaimed cultural historian Alwyn W. Turner, explores the curious and contested origins of Doctor Who's greatest villains, and sheds light on a strange world of ambitious young writers, producers and performers without whom British culture today would look very different.","From generating ideas to gaining your first paying customers, The 7 Day Startup is the bootstrapper's bible for launching your next product.

Covering the twelve months of 1916, eminent historian Keith Jeffery uses twelve moments from a range of locations and shows how they reverberated around the world.

Dyerand co-author Dee Garneshad often talked about how the ones who know the most about God are those who have just recently been wrapped in the arms of the Divine, our infants and toddlers. In fact, Dee had an interaction with her own young son that convinced her of this. Curious about this phenomenon, Wayne and Dee decided to issue an invitation to parents all over the world to share their experiences. The overwhelming response they received prompted them to put together , which includes the most interesting and illuminating of these stories in which very young children speak about their remembrances before they were born.\nIt seems that infants and toddlers often arrive here with memories of their lifetimes in the spirit world and frequently provide evidence of this to their immediate families. They tell of dialogues with God, give evidence that they themselves had a hand in picking their own parents, speak about long-deceased family members they knew while in the dimension of Spirit, verify past-life recollections, and speak eloquently and accurately of a kind of Divine love that exists beyond this physical realm--and even of times when telepathic munication took place, as well as the ability to decide just when they would e here to Earth.\nThis fascinating book encourages parents and grandparents to take a much more active role in municating with their new arrivals . . . and to realize that there is far more to this earthly experience than what we perceive with our five senses.","After a fleeting encounter in a nightclub, an old friend of Sara suggests they start a fuck buddy relationship.

The very model of blond Aryan \"purity,\" Irmgard sat on the Fuhrer's knee for photographers, witnessed with excitement the ings and goings of all manner of famous personages, and with the blindness of a child accepted the Nazi doctrine that most of her family and everyone around her so eagerly embraced. Here, in a picture-postcard world untouched by the war and seemingly unblemished by the horrors Germany's master had wrought, she accepted the lies of her teachers and church and civic leaders, joined the Hitler Youth at age ten, and joyfully sang the songs extolling the virtues of National Socialism.\nBut before the end -- when she and other children would be forced to cower in terror in dank bomb shelters and wartime deprivations would take a harrowing toll -- Irmgard's doubts about the \"truths\" she had been force-fed increased, fueled by the few brave souls who had not accepted Hitler and his abominations. After the fall of the brutal dictatorship and the suicide of its mad architect, many of her neighbors and loved ones still clung to their beliefs, prejudices, denial, and unacknowledged guilt. Irmgard, often feeling lonely in her quest, was determined to face the truth of her country's criminal past and to bear the responsibility for an almost unbearable reality that most of her elders were determined to forget. She resolved even then that the lessons of her youth would guide her actions and steel her mitment to defend the freedoms and democratic values that had been so easily dismissed by the German people.\nProvocative and astonishing, Irmgard A. Hunt's On Hitler's Mountain offers a unique, gripping, and vitally important first-person perspective on a tumultuous era in modern history, as viewed through the eyes of a child -- a candid and fascinating document, free of rationalization and whitewash, that chronicles the devastating moral collapse of a civilized nation.","Matt Tavares's lavish illustrations illuminate this definitive edition of a beloved seasonal classic.\nThe horse is ready, the air is bracing, and everyone is bundled into the sleigh.

First published in 1916, it is a classic of American literature. Archy is a cockroach, inside whom resides the soul of a free-verse poet; he municates with Don Marquis by leaping upon the keys of the columnist's typewriter. In poems of varying length, Archy pithily describes his wee world, the main fixture of which is Mehitabel, a devil-may-care alley cat. Archy music will linger in your head long after you finish the book. Here's a tiny taste from his interview with a mummy: \n\"what ho\nmy regal leatherface says i \ngreetings\nlittle scatter footed\nscarab\nsays he\" \nWriters (particularly journalists) can go lifetimes without attaining such loose-limbed grace. And the illustrations by George Herriman (\"Krazy Kat\") provide the perfect counterpoint. On top of all that, Marquis did the impossible: he made a cockroach loveable.","The vile face of Thanos left audiences in shock after last summer's Marvel Studios' \"The Avengers\" movie...but who is this eerily disturbing villain?

Among the poems he left behind are a particularly unsettling four that feature the mysterious Robinson: both a prototypical member of the smart set--masking his desperation with urbane savoir-faire--and an alter ego for the troubled Kees himself.\nIn ROBINSON ALONE, Kathleen Rooney performs a bold act of literary mediumship, conjuring Kees through his borrowed character to sketch his restless journey across locales and milieus--New York, San Francisco, the highways between--and to evoke his ambitions, his frustrations, and his skewed humor.

Born in 1926, his youth was an hysterical odyssey through depression-era America with an unstable mother who would bee the basis for several of his most memorable characters. His adult life was scarredby alcoholism, divorce, mental illness and bitterness at his lack of public recognition. Yates always teetered on the edge of some fresh calamity: he chain-smoked through bouts of tuberculosis and emphysema, even when permanently chained to oxygen cylinders, and burned down his own apartment at least once. However, the chaos of Richard Yates' personal life fed directly into his unflinching portraits of American middle-class desperation, leading him to write Revolutionary Road, the novel that made his reputation, The Easter Parade, and his extraordinary short fiction.","Butterfly Burningbrings the brilliantly poetic voice of Zimbabwean writer Yvonne Vera to American readers for the first time.

The qualities that drew Fumbatha to her, her sense of independence and freedom, end up separating them. And the closely woven fabric of township life, where everyone knows everyone else, has a mesh too tight and too intricate to allow her to escape her circumstances on her own.\nVera exploits language to peel away the skin of public and private lives. In Butterfly Burningshe captures the ebullience and the bitterness of township life, as well as the strength and courage of her unforgettable heroine.","Do lobsters feel pain?

Yo no escribo aqui historia contemporanea. Pero si quiero dejar constancia de mi amargura, mas fuerte de lo que nunca habia imaginado poder sentir\". Son las palabras iniciales de las mas de mil quinientas paginas que pletan unos diarios llevados en riguroso secreto durante los anos de la dictadura nazi, salvados milagrosamente de la guerra y del exterminio judio. Estos diarios permanecieron ocultos durante decadas hasta que un antiguo discipulo de Klemperer los descubrio y edito hace unos anos en Alemania.\n-------------------------\nLos diarios que resenamos ienzan el 14 de enero de 1933 y finalizan el 10 de junio de 1945. Durante estos largos anos, Victor Klemperer, casado con una mujer \"aria\", Eva Schlemmer, anota con perseverancia y sobriedad las vejaciones y humillaciones sufridas bajo el Tercer Reich: la expulsion de su catedra, las expropiaciones, la prohibicion de consultar bibliotecas o visitar jardines, las obligadas mudanzas a Casas Judias, la imposicion de trabajos forzados, la estigmatizacion, la constante e imprevisible amenaza de deportacion y exterminio, la idiocia e impiedad de vecinos germanos o judios ante la ignominia y el desafuero, pero sin ocultar los escasos gestos de generosidad de la poblacion alemana.\nSon memorables las paginas dedicadas a la tormenta de fuego que asolo la ciudad de Dresde el 13 de febrero de 1945 bajo las miles de toneladas de bombas incendiarias arrojadas por las fortalezas volantes britanicas; azar que posibilito a la pareja Klemperer su desesperada fuga hacia Munich a traves de las ruinas de una Alemania desolada y proxima a la derrota. Entranable es el cuidado mutuo que se prestan ambos en los momentos de fragilidad, su costumbre de leer en voz alta, el amor a los gatos y al cine, su cercania al humor y los chistes de las victimas. Y sin embargo los analisis introspectivos de Klemperer no se ahorran ajustes de cuentas consigo mismo, el interlocutor mas cruel, rasgo tipico del diarista educado en la fe protestante que al no contar con el sacramento de la confesion no se engana tan facilmente con indulgencias.\nGracias a esta sinceridad en absoluto autoplaciente, Klemperer reconoce a menudo o la sensacion de poder que confiere el instante de la supervivencia suele imponerse a los estados de duelo y pasion. El paulatino proceso de desmantelamiento interno de su identidad alemana, el conflicto entre la imposibilidad y la necesidad de ser judio, el descubrimiento de o el vencido respira y vive segun el lenguaje del vencedor (sin llegar tan lejos o Barthes que afirmo que todo lenguaje es \"fascista\", pues por su estructura implica una relacion fatal de obediencia y alienacion), la renuncia a todo consuelo filosofico o religioso sobre la invio-\nlabilidad de la dignidad interior, todo ello aproxima la obra de Victor Klemperer a la de Jean Amery. Ciertamente, el lector no se sentira defraudado por este tesoro de memoria, coraje civico e ilustracion.\n-------------------------\nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933, Victor Klemperer (1881-1960), honored as a frontline veteran of World War I, was a distinguished professor at the University of Dresden. A scant few months later he was merely a Jew, protected from deportation to a death camp only by his marriage to an Aryan. He suffered every other indignity to which German Jews were subjected, from losing his job to having his driver's license revoked to being denied permission to own a pet, and all are recorded with bitter clarity in his diary entries, which cover the years 1933 to 1941. (A second volume continuing through 1945 will be published in English in 1999.) The German edition of  caused a sensation when it was published in 1995, and it's easy to see why: the relentless, quotidian nature of Nazi racism es through forcefully in Klemperer's litany of daily humiliations and insults, a painful chronicle of situations in which readers can readily imagine themselves. Like Anne Frank, but with a more adult understanding of political fanaticism and human weakness, he makes the abstract horror of genocidal persecution very intimate, very personal, and very real. --Wendy Smith","New York Timesbestselling author Carla Neggers returns with this absorbing, twisting tale of suspense, romance and fast-paced action, the latest in her popular Sharpe & Donovan series.\nEmma Sharpe and Colin Donovan, two of the FBI's most valuable agents, are preparing for their next big assignment--their wedding--when Colin's brother Mike alerts them that onetime friends from his military past are on Sharpe and Donovan home turf on the Maine coast.

The play premiered in Chicago in 1944, & in 1945 won the prestigious NY Drama Critics Circle Award. It was his 1st successful play; he went on to bee one of America's most highly regarded playwrights.\nThe play was reworked from one of Williams's short stories \"Portrait of a Girl in Glass\" (written 6/1943, published 1948). The story is also written from the point of view of narrator Tom Wingfield, & many of his monologues from Glass Menagerie seem lifted straight from this original. Certain elements have clearly been omitted from the play. Generally the story contains the same plot as the play, with certain sections given more emphasis, and character details edited.\nThe Glass Menagerie is accounted by many to be an autobiographical play about Williams's life, the characters & story mimicking his own more closely than any of his other works. Williams (whose real name is Thomas) would be Tom, his Mother, Amanda & his sickly & supposedly mentally ill sister Rose would be Laura (whose nickname in the play is \"Blue Roses\", a result of an unfortunate bout of Pleurosis as a hs student). It has been suggested as well that the character of Laura is based upon Williams himself, referencing his introvert nature & obsessive focus on one part of life.\nThe play is introduced to the audience by Tom as a memory play, based on his recollection of his mother Amanda & his sister Laura. Amanda's husband left the family long ago, & she remains stuck in the past. Tom works in a warehouse, doing his best to support them. He chafes under the banality and boredom of everyday life & spends much of his spare time watching movies in cheap cinemas.

Tom eventually brings Jim home for dinner at the insistence of his mother, who hopes Jim will be the long-awaited suitor for Laura. Laura realizes that Jim is the man she loved in hs & has thought of ever since. He dashes her hopes, telling her that he is already engaged, & then leaves. Tom leaves too, & never returns to see his family again. However, Tom still remembers his sister, Laura.","Ever since vampirism became illegal, the undead have been hunted to near-extinction.
